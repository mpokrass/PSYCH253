# PSYCH 253

## Lecture 2 - Sep 9

Social psychology is the study of social thinking (how we perceive ourselves and others), social influence, and social relations.

### Information Processing Model

Goal-regulation theory. There are many models of human behaviour.

We are biased information processors.

### Theory of mind

Implied consequences of actions. You are able to infer that people around you also have minds and are sentient. Other beings have unobservable mental processes going on.

A _social brain_ is related to interpersonal interactions. Social animals demonstrate complex and large brain mass. 

Eg. chimpanzees can recognize intention.

Social behaviour is learned - we start as ego-centric individuals.

Children under the age of 3.5 fail perspective taking.

People with autism have a lack of social skills, perform poorly at perspective-taking tasks. (eg. with a picture of eyes, telling what they are expressing).

### Social Facilitation

Bike riders did better when in the presence of others. Triplett had people perform against others (simulated fish reeling)

Some individuals are faciliated by the presence of others. But some experienced inhibition of behaviour (nervous tension/anxiety)

Zajonc theorized that dominant responses are augmented by audiences.

Mere presence vs audience have different results.

Arousal and drive result in higher expression of dominant responses.

Yerkes-Dodson law: there is an optimum amount of arousal/drive.

Realistically everyone has their own arousal curve.

## Lecture 3 - sept 14

Where does self-concept/self-identity come from?

We use behaviours to extrapolate instances where we are good at different things and derive abstract representations - self-schemas. It becomes very ingrained, very core to us.

We often change our concept of self depending on our environment, who we interact with. 

We look to other people to evaluate ourselves. 

We use comparisons with other people when we are threatened with our identity/sense of self. We make downward comparisons to increase our mood.

We also make upwards social comparisons => negative mood. Sometimes though, if we have confidence in our own capabilities, looking upwards may not always end up in negative affective state. May be inspiring, if we feel like we could achieve this state.

Happiness moderates impact of social comparisons.

Had people to word unscrambles. Had people perform really fast or slow - makes an implicit social comparison. Test subjects also reported their own ability.

People with below average happiness were more affected by a faster peer. 

Another study: asked participants to create a puppet show with 2 puppets. In order to manipulate comparisons, they had a confederate perform the same tasks. The confederate always got one type of feedback. In the upwards comparison, subjects got got positive feedback, but they were still worse than the confederate. So positive feedback + upwards comparison. Measured changes in mood pre + post comparison. In the downwards comparison condition subjects got rated poorly, but confederate did even worse than them. 

Had happy + sad participants to start. __Look at slides for these result graphs__

In collectivistic cultures achievement is attained as a group, as opposed to individualistic western cultures.

Another study compared reward distributions of collectivists vs individualists. 

Independent variable: performance (high vs low) and anonymity (anonymous vs not)

DV: distribution of monetary rewards

Americans followed equity principle: i did more work so i deserve more.

Chinese followed equality principle, gave equal allocation regardless of work.

Difference disappeared when allocation was anonymous. Anonymity allowed people to lose identity (eg. lose collectivist identity)

Our self-knowledge isn't very objective. Impact bias and planning fallacy (in textbook). 

Impact bias - overrepresenting positive feelings from something, eg team winning or new iphone.

Planning fallacy - when you overrepresent the time we spend working on something. We think that we have laser focus into what our behaviour will be/our motivation. But we can't comprehend all of the extraneous behaviours that influence us. Their are situational influences that modify our behaviour.

Study: record how long we're going to be spending on 10 different activities. 24 different blanks - for each hour in the day, what they might be doing. 

DV: predect how you might feel if team won or lost football game (football fans).

Wins and losses are both mitigated (happier losing, less happy winning) because they see what else is part of their day. 

Another correlational study, observe fans feelings over losses. Very slight increased in baseline mood after loss (so many other things going on in their lives - pychological immune system). 

Same after winning, slight decrease in happiness actually. 

When no game, thanksgiving, high increase in happiness.

We experience feelings completely different to how we predict them. The way we predict them also affects how we experience them.

Another study, participants predicted their happiness and then gave an actual rating. When you add more details to your day, you realize that the impact of the football game is low. We have very poor introspective abilities. 

Another correlation study - what is people's dispositional level of happiness? Predict happiness after getting final grades, and then measure them. Had no correlation to how they actually felt. You think you're gonna feel a certain way - but it actually has no bearing on what you actually feel. 

## Lecture 4 - Sep 16

Poor access to our mental processes. Explicit vs implicit attitudes. Cognitive conscious thoughts, and automatic thoughts. No correlation between these two (explicit thought vs implicit association). 

People try to explain implicit thoughts but often get them very wrong. Implicit attitudes test. 

Social desirability bias - don't want to have these implicit associations. Spreading activation - adjacent neurons. Some of the concepts will be more closely associated than others. 

Self esteem is your attitude towards or evaluation of the self. Our self esteem is a socio-meter. Indicator of how well we are doing in our social environment. People are motivated to maintain high self esteem. 

Low self-esteem predicts aggression, anti-social behaviour, and deliquency. 

In the late 90s and early 2000s, psychologists wanted improve people's self esteem, eg. participation trophies. 

But narcissists (inflated self esteem) are agressive and anti social too. More likely to retaliate when threatened. Can become extremist. 

Study measured explicit vs implicit self esteem. People with explicit high self esteem actually had lower implicit self esteem. Donut people. Unstable sense of self. 

Explicit self esteem really doesn't mean much. 

Self-control is social. We inhibit primitive pre-potent inpulses for delayed rewards (willpower). Poor self-control predicts anti-social behaviour. 

Ego-depletion: exerting self-control reduces subsequent efforts. 

Taste perception: please don't eat 3 hours before. 

IV resist temptation to eat cookies (ate radishes) vs taste-test the cookies vs no food control group

Asked group 1 to not eat cookies (self control), group 2 let them eat cookies, group 3 no food.

DV: presistence at an impossible tracing task. Having eaten radishes and depleted self control, group 1 gave up on the task much before the other groups. 

Depleting self control resources. Argument that it is a self-fulfilling prophecy: beliefs and attitudes shape our behaviour. 

We balance our want-to and have-to selves. 

Another study: read different descriptions of willpower. group 1: willpower is limited and needs rest and recovery. group 2: exerting willpower can be energizing for other activities. 

Half of participants exerted self-control and half did a control task. Cross study, 4 groups. Willpower - cross out letter Es in a passage. Other study had specific Es to cross out. 
DV: performance at self-control task (stroop task).

Results showed that we don't really understand self control. People can be trained into it not depleting. (Like above study)

We fail at predicting the future self. Hyperbolic discounting. 100 now vs 120 in a week or 120 in a month vs 140 in 5 weeks. We have a bias for the present moment. People who get into debt. 

Self-serving bias: success = self vs failure = situation. This maintains our self-esteem. Eg. group projects: everyone thinks that they did more work. 

Theory of mind: able to perceive what other people are thinking. We present desirable images of ourselves. We feel less need to do impression management around friends. This is because the people around you know you already.

## Lecture 5 - Sep 19

Context matters - new and old cues in your environment will shape your actions. Social beliefs and judgements dictate how you perceive the situation and how you act in it. Our judgements and preconceptions are cued by out context. Can have implicit cues that prime different behaviours (don't even notice). 

We analyze our environment and make patterns/predictions. We later rely on these patterns, sometimes unconsciously. 

Priming - cognitive concepts can be activated through primes, influencing our behaviour. The brain is a collection of neural networks, activating one node can lead to "spreading actiation". 

Can we subconsciously prime and change behvaiours? 

IV: primed with concept of rude vs polite vs neutral. Completed a scrambled sentence task. 

DV: polite vs rude behaviour. Experimenter was stuck "explaining" the SST to confederate (timed how long it took participant to interrupt). (pulled into a room, experimenter was helping explain to confederate). Timed how long it would take them to interrupt. 

People who were primed with politeness interrupted significantly less, then neutral, then rude. 

Are social judgements related to behaviour; can they too be primed?

IV: primed with concept of elderly vs neutral (scrambled sentence task)

DV: gave debrief on study, then left. Timed how long took them to walk to elevator to leave. 

They thought people primed with elderly thoughts would be slower, and they were. Replicated this again in another study. This suggests that even without explicitly targeting a behaviour, the generalized stereotype was enough to cause the behaviour. 

We should be cognisant of all of the things that influence our behaviour. 

-
Can hostile behaviour be primed with an African-American stereotype. 

Subliminal vs supraliminal `!=` unconscious vs conscious. 

Conscious vs unconscious: can bring to the front of mind/working memory, vs not able to.

Subliminal: outside of conscious perceptual field. 

Faces shown subliminally during long, boring estimation task. Higher ecological validity. We might not ever be aware of these things. 

People who were primed with black faces were more hostile than those primed with caucasian faces. We can never be 100% aware of all of our biases. 

-

Patient with blindsight (had stroke in right side of brain, couldn't perceive the left side of the world). 

Showed patient pictures of houses and asked her to select her preference. One of the houses was on fire on the left side. 9/11 times she chose the non burning house. When the house was burning on the right side, she correctly chose the house. 

-
Schemas don't only affect current behaviour, but memories as well. Schemas drive our automatic associative behaviour. 

Misinformation effect: incorporating schema-congruent information resulting in false memories. This works because the misinformation _feels right_. Confidence doesn't always predict reality. 

-
Belief perserverance: people believe firmly in their judgements and are hard to persuade. 

People use strength over weight when evaluating confidence. Strength of their memories over weight. 

Strength: positive/warmth of a reference letter (eg. size of an effect)

Weight: credibility of the source (eg. sample size)

Flip a coin 5 times and it's all heads: strength is high, weight is low. 

IV: presented with 12 coin=spinning scenarios. Bias of 60% but not sure where it's biased to.

DV: asked people which way they thought it was skewed. 

People over-guessed how likely it was. s

Testimonials work well because the strength is high. 

-
Hyperbolic discounting: as things get further in time, they get more similar. We value the present moment much more.
