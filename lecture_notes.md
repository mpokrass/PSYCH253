# PSYCH 253

## Lecture 2 - Sep 9

Social psychology is the study of social thinking (how we perceive ourselves and others), social influence, and social relations.

### Information Processing Model

Goal-regulation theory. There are many models of human behaviour.

We are biased information processors.

### Theory of mind

Implied consequences of actions. You are able to infer that people around you also have minds and are sentient. Other beings have unobservable mental processes going on.

A _social brain_ is related to interpersonal interactions. Social animals demonstrate complex and large brain mass. 

Eg. chimpanzees can recognize intention.

Social behaviour is learned - we start as ego-centric individuals.

Children under the age of 3.5 fail perspective taking.

People with autism have a lack of social skills, perform poorly at perspective-taking tasks. (eg. with a picture of eyes, telling what they are expressing).

### Social Facilitation

Bike riders did better when in the presence of others. Triplett had people perform against others (simulated fish reeling)

Some individuals are faciliated by the presence of others. But some experienced inhibition of behaviour (nervous tension/anxiety)

Zajonc theorized that dominant responses are augmented by audiences.

Mere presence vs audience have different results.

Arousal and drive result in higher expression of dominant responses.

Yerkes-Dodson law: there is an optimum amount of arousal/drive.

Realistically everyone has their own arousal curve.

## Lecture 3 - sept 14

Where does self-concept/self-identity come from?

We use behaviours to extrapolate instances where we are good at different things and derive abstract representations - self-schemas. It becomes very ingrained, very core to us.

We often change our concept of self depending on our environment, who we interact with. 

We look to other people to evaluate ourselves. 

We use comparisons with other people when we are threatened with our identity/sense of self. We make downward comparisons to increase our mood.

We also make upwards social comparisons => negative mood. Sometimes though, if we have confidence in our own capabilities, looking upwards may not always end up in negative affective state. May be inspiring, if we feel like we could achieve this state.

Happiness moderates impact of social comparisons.

Had people to word unscrambles. Had people perform really fast or slow - makes an implicit social comparison. Test subjects also reported their own ability.

People with below average happiness were more affected by a faster peer. 

Another study: asked participants to create a puppet show with 2 puppets. In order to manipulate comparisons, they had a confederate perform the same tasks. The confederate always got one type of feedback. In the upwards comparison, subjects got got positive feedback, but they were still worse than the confederate. So positive feedback + upwards comparison. Measured changes in mood pre + post comparison. In the downwards comparison condition subjects got rated poorly, but confederate did even worse than them. 

Had happy + sad participants to start. __Look at slides for these result graphs__

In collectivistic cultures achievement is attained as a group, as opposed to individualistic western cultures.

Another study compared reward distributions of collectivists vs individualists. 

Independent variable: performance (high vs low) and anonymity (anonymous vs not)

DV: distribution of monetary rewards

Americans followed equity principle: i did more work so i deserve more.

Chinese followed equality principle, gave equal allocation regardless of work.

Difference disappeared when allocation was anonymous. Anonymity allowed people to lose identity (eg. lose collectivist identity)

Our self-knowledge isn't very objective. Impact bias and planning fallacy (in textbook). 

Impact bias - overrepresenting positive feelings from something, eg team winning or new iphone.

Planning fallacy - when you overrepresent the time we spend working on something. We think that we have laser focus into what our behaviour will be/our motivation. But we can't comprehend all of the extraneous behaviours that influence us. Their are situational influences that modify our behaviour.

Study: record how long we're going to be spending on 10 different activities. 24 different blanks - for each hour in the day, what they might be doing. 

DV: predect how you might feel if team won or lost football game (football fans).

Wins and losses are both mitigated (happier losing, less happy winning) because they see what else is part of their day. 

Another correlational study, observe fans feelings over losses. Very slight increased in baseline mood after loss (so many other things going on in their lives - pychological immune system). 

Same after winning, slight decrease in happiness actually. 

When no game, thanksgiving, high increase in happiness.

We experience feelings completely different to how we predict them. The way we predict them also affects how we experience them.

Another study, participants predicted their happiness and then gave an actual rating. When you add more details to your day, you realize that the impact of the football game is low. We have very poor introspective abilities. 

Another correlation study - what is people's dispositional level of happiness? Predict happiness after getting final grades, and then measure them. Had no correlation to how they actually felt. You think you're gonna feel a certain way - but it actually has no bearing on what you actually feel. 

## Lecture 4 - Sep 16

Poor access to our mental processes. Explicit vs implicit attitudes. Cognitive conscious thoughts, and automatic thoughts. No correlation between these two (explicit thought vs implicit association). 

People try to explain implicit thoughts but often get them very wrong. Implicit attitudes test. 

Social desirability bias - don't want to have these implicit associations. Spreading activation - adjacent neurons. Some of the concepts will be more closely associated than others. 

Self esteem is your attitude towards or evaluation of the self. Our self esteem is a socio-meter. Indicator of how well we are doing in our social environment. People are motivated to maintain high self esteem. 

Low self-esteem predicts aggression, anti-social behaviour, and deliquency. 

In the late 90s and early 2000s, psychologists wanted improve people's self esteem, eg. participation trophies. 

But narcissists (inflated self esteem) are agressive and anti social too. More likely to retaliate when threatened. Can become extremist. 

Study measured explicit vs implicit self esteem. People with explicit high self esteem actually had lower implicit self esteem. Donut people. Unstable sense of self. 

Explicit self esteem really doesn't mean much. 

Self-control is social. We inhibit primitive pre-potent inpulses for delayed rewards (willpower). Poor self-control predicts anti-social behaviour. 

Ego-depletion: exerting self-control reduces subsequent efforts. 

Taste perception: please don't eat 3 hours before. 

IV resist temptation to eat cookies (ate radishes) vs taste-test the cookies vs no food control group

Asked group 1 to not eat cookies (self control), group 2 let them eat cookies, group 3 no food.

DV: presistence at an impossible tracing task. Having eaten radishes and depleted self control, group 1 gave up on the task much before the other groups. 

Depleting self control resources. Argument that it is a self-fulfilling prophecy: beliefs and attitudes shape our behaviour. 

We balance our want-to and have-to selves. 

Another study: read different descriptions of willpower. group 1: willpower is limited and needs rest and recovery. group 2: exerting willpower can be energizing for other activities. 

Half of participants exerted self-control and half did a control task. Cross study, 4 groups. Willpower - cross out letter Es in a passage. Other study had specific Es to cross out. 
DV: performance at self-control task (stroop task).

Results showed that we don't really understand self control. People can be trained into it not depleting. (Like above study)

We fail at predicting the future self. Hyperbolic discounting. 100 now vs 120 in a week or 120 in a month vs 140 in 5 weeks. We have a bias for the present moment. People who get into debt. 

Self-serving bias: success = self vs failure = situation. This maintains our self-esteem. Eg. group projects: everyone thinks that they did more work. 

Theory of mind: able to perceive what other people are thinking. We present desirable images of ourselves. We feel less need to do impression management around friends. This is because the people around you know you already.

## Lecture 5 - Sep 19

Context matters - new and old cues in your environment will shape your actions. Social beliefs and judgements dictate how you perceive the situation and how you act in it. Our judgements and preconceptions are cued by out context. Can have implicit cues that prime different behaviours (don't even notice). 

We analyze our environment and make patterns/predictions. We later rely on these patterns, sometimes unconsciously. 

Priming - cognitive concepts can be activated through primes, influencing our behaviour. The brain is a collection of neural networks, activating one node can lead to "spreading actiation". 

Can we subconsciously prime and change behvaiours? 

IV: primed with concept of rude vs polite vs neutral. Completed a scrambled sentence task. 

DV: polite vs rude behaviour. Experimenter was stuck "explaining" the SST to confederate (timed how long it took participant to interrupt). (pulled into a room, experimenter was helping explain to confederate). Timed how long it would take them to interrupt. 

People who were primed with politeness interrupted significantly less, then neutral, then rude. 

Are social judgements related to behaviour; can they too be primed?

IV: primed with concept of elderly vs neutral (scrambled sentence task)

DV: gave debrief on study, then left. Timed how long took them to walk to elevator to leave. 

They thought people primed with elderly thoughts would be slower, and they were. Replicated this again in another study. This suggests that even without explicitly targeting a behaviour, the generalized stereotype was enough to cause the behaviour. 

We should be cognisant of all of the things that influence our behaviour. 

-
Can hostile behaviour be primed with an African-American stereotype. 

Subliminal vs supraliminal `!=` unconscious vs conscious. 

Conscious vs unconscious: can bring to the front of mind/working memory, vs not able to.

Subliminal: outside of conscious perceptual field. 

Faces shown subliminally during long, boring estimation task. Higher ecological validity. We might not ever be aware of these things. 

People who were primed with black faces were more hostile than those primed with caucasian faces. We can never be 100% aware of all of our biases. 

-

Patient with blindsight (had stroke in right side of brain, couldn't perceive the left side of the world). 

Showed patient pictures of houses and asked her to select her preference. One of the houses was on fire on the left side. 9/11 times she chose the non burning house. When the house was burning on the right side, she correctly chose the house. 

-
Schemas don't only affect current behaviour, but memories as well. Schemas drive our automatic associative behaviour. 

Misinformation effect: incorporating schema-congruent information resulting in false memories. This works because the misinformation _feels right_. Confidence doesn't always predict reality. 

-
Belief perserverance: people believe firmly in their judgements and are hard to persuade. 

People use strength over weight when evaluating confidence. Strength of their memories over weight. 

Strength: positive/warmth of a reference letter (eg. size of an effect)

Weight: credibility of the source (eg. sample size)

Flip a coin 5 times and it's all heads: strength is high, weight is low. 

IV: presented with 12 coin=spinning scenarios. Bias of 60% but not sure where it's biased to.

DV: asked people which way they thought it was skewed. 

People over-guessed how likely it was. s

Testimonials work well because the strength is high. 

-
Hyperbolic discounting: as things get further in time, they get more similar. We value the present moment much more. 

## Lecture 6 - Sep 21

Confirmation bias: we focus on evidence that supports, rather than falsifies our intuitions. We don't look for stuff that is against our views. Look for info that confirms our beleifs, no matter how weak it is.

-
IV: difficulty of passage stimulus (disfluency). Presented in hard to read font.

DV: stance on capital punishment (controlling for political ideology). 

-
The reasons we utilize conf bias is because we make use of heuristics. They are mental shortcuts, save our cognitive capacity. Lets us save executive function for more important things.

We store schemas instead of memories. Our brains are very efficient. 

Availability heuristic: recent/available information biases our judgements. 

Representativeness heuristic: our mental schemas or representations colour our intuitive judgements. 

These biases typically work for us, but in some situations they fail us. 

-
Illusory correlation: two distinct events become linked; increased attention to rare events.

Illusory control: gambling; individuals believe they have influence on the outcome. 

More likely to react with negative reinforcement.

-
Tested the idea of "paired distinctiveness".

We are likely to associate events together.

IV: read about group a or group b individuals. 

39 statements more positive (27) than negative (12) statements (9:4)
26 in group a, 13 in group b (2:1)

DV: accuracy in recalling behaviours, estimates of typical traits of group members.

Individuals over-estimated the likelihood that group b had negative traits, inaccurately recalled more negative behaviours. 

-
counter factual thinking

Hypothetical scenarios with alternative outcomes that "almost" happened.

Can be near misses (downward) or (upward) in nature.

Purposes for this type of thinking?

- suggested that we use it for affective reasons
- also for preparation for future events (avoid some negative result, therefore motivational)

-
Attribution theory

We perceived behaviour in terms of "causes" (recall theory of mind)

Fundamental attribution error: we lack information, more likely to attribute behaviour to internal (vs external)

Dispositional attribution vs situational attribution. Have more insight to the reasons behind your actions. We have more leeway for our own actions. 

-
Ross et al. study 1

Participants brought into a lab for a quiz game experiment, no confederates.

IV: experimental vs control condition

- experimental: questioner developed hard questions for contestants (q will know answer, reflective of intelligence)
- control: questioner asked pre-selected questions for contestant (q may not know answer)

DV: self ratings of knowledge, and partner's knowledge.

E: contestants rated questioner as smarter, own intelligence rated as about average
C: contestants rated questioner as less smart, themselves as more smart

-
Study 2

Replication of study 1 except participants are observers, everyone else is a confederate.

Watched questioner come up with 10 questions, and contestant had to answer.

DV: ratings of knowledge of questioner and contestants.

- q mean knowledge: 82
- c mean knowledge: 40

Summary: we are more prone to attribute to disposition rather than situation. 

Study 2, even stronger effect. Demonstrates actor-observer bias. Lack of insight into perspective of actor and under-valuing influence of social environment. 

-
Self fulfilling prophecy: 

Partipants given role of an interview

IV: white vs black confederate

DV: video taped and measured social cues towards to confederate

Differential treatment of black and white confederates. Both confederates trained to act/answer in same ways.

Interviewers sat further away from black confederates. 

-
Will interviewer behaviour influence performance?

Flipped, confederates were interviewers.

IV: more vs less positive social cues (eg. longer interview, closer distance, verbal errors)

DV: interview performance rated by observers

Results as expected. 

## Lecture 7 - Sep 23

Social situation derives your identity. 

Slacktivism. 

Sometimes we have specific attitudes towards a behaviour that we don't follow through on. We don't necessarily follow through on our intentions. 

Attitudes have an evaluative component. We think about mental objects, and evaluate them in some way. They are ingrained in our memories. Part of the attitudes are implicit.

We also have affective, behavioural, and cognitive consequences. Dual attitudes - implicit vs explicit. Work together to predict our behaviour. 

When your attitudes are primed in your mind/strongly represented, then you are more likely to act in accordance with your attitudes. 

-
Study, participants completed go/no go task. Presented with specific stimuli, press a button in response, or not press button. Respond to odd numbers, withhold when given letters.

IV: experimental group develop a specific plan to respond to a number vs control group spent time looking over stimuli. 

Developing specific attitudes and intentions leads to better attitude-behaviour consistency. 

Potent attitudes -> behaviours.

Being inconsistent with our attitudes creates a type of tension. Drawing attention to self-awareness will improve attitude-behaviour congruency. (Cognitive dissonance)

-
Participants come into lab for a "teaching" experiment. 

Pre-screened individuals for punishment attitudes. Private: I believe that the use of physical punishment could never be considered right.

Public: most people believe that the use of physical punishment could never be considered right.

When attitudes become more salient will make you more likely to be consistent with attitudes.

IV: control vs eye level mirror vs audience (public norms) vs audience (no public norms)

PArticpants had to teach confederate a list of words, shock them every time they made a mistake.

Eye level mirror to induce self awareness, or audience watching, or audience but they weren't evaluating the individual. Hyp: audience evaluating has more of an effect on self awareness than audience not evaluating. 

case 1: only selected people with lower condoning of punishment. These people shocked less than control. Attitudes became stronger predictor. When alone, less consistent with attitudes.

(people who believed in punishment). When they were made self aware, more likely to punish.

Private attitudes -> behaviour when self-aware using a mirror

-
Theory of planned behaviour.

Behaviour having recursive effect, bi-directional relationship. 

Some actors, in order to get into the mindset, they live their lives that way to think and believe in the same way as that character. Doing a certain behaviour can affect our thoughts and attitudes. 

-
Stanford prison experiment. Everyone's behaviour became very extreme, stopped experiment early. 

## Lecture 8 - Sep 26

20 m/c from textbook readings

theme of the course - based on understanding of social psych, not concerned with names/dates. 

-
Harmon Jones study

Do behaviours increase commitment and change attitudes?

IV: made a difficult (more similar choices) vs easy decision (choose easy thing vs hard thing)

DV: measured attitudes towards decision. 

After you make a decisional commitment to one choice, you start to dislike the other one more, even if liked it more before decision. 

Other examples: foot in the door, saying becomes believing, lowball technique. 

What are the mechanisms behind this?

Might help us cope with the fact that we are forced to do something. 

Cognitive dissonance, Self-presentation, self perception.

Want to present a consistent self to the world. Don't want to perform a behaviour and say you are doing something else. 

We like to resolve our cognitive tension and align our behaviours and thoughts. 

Self-perception: when our attitudes aren't formed yet. We perform behaviours without knowing why, and observe it, and then come up with reasons as to why. 

-
Self-presentation

We don't want to look like liars. Want to show the world that we are consistent in terms of thoughts and behaviours. If i lose my favourite glasses - I didn't like those glasses anyways. 

Tice study - does our public self-image affect how much our attitudes change following behaviour?

Partipants were told to portray a trait during an assessment interview (even if they didn't have it).

IV: public vs privately demonstrated (one-way mirror)

- emotional stabillity
- emotional responsiveness

Did behaving this way (private vs public) influence people's attitudes? 

Cross study: either stability/responsiveness, either private/public. So 4 cases. 

Control was athleticism, so extra 2 cases. 

Hypothesis: public presentation changes.

DV: self-ratings of portrayed trait.

Talked on intercom to grad student (public) or recording answers (private). 

After completing interview questions - rate their own traits that they were asked to exhibit.

Those asked to be stable rated themselves as more stable, and vice versa. 

Evidence for self-presentation theory. Present/change attitudes when in a public setting.

In control, self ratings (scale 0-25) were more average (12-13)

All the particpants knew they were being told to act this way, but still internalized it as their disposition. 

Tice - study 2:

replicated study 1 and extended it to see if self-presented behaviour -> attitude -> behaviour.

IV: introverted vs extroverted

IV: public vs private

DV: measured self-ratings

DV: how far they sat away from confederate, how many conversations they initiated with confederate

results:

- self rating in extraversion was lower in those told to be introverted, sat further away from research confederate

We are not changing attitude just for world to see, it also affects our behaviour. Makes our behaviour congruent with actions. 

Self presentation plays a key role in shifting our attitudes following behaviour. 

We want to create a consistent image of ourselves. 

-
Self justification; cognitive dissonance

We don't want to look/feel like liars. Want our behaviour to match our attitudes.

Conflicting, inconsistent cognitions create tensions. Reduce dissonance by adjusting our thinking and our attitudes (instead of behaviour). 

Changing the behaviour isn't possible because you did it already, can only change cognition. 

Explaining away our behaviour to make our cognitions make sense. Can't undo the behaviour. 

-
Study: hour long boring peg-turning task. 

Then asked to tell another "participant" that it was fun. How do we resolve this conflict? 

IV: paid either `$1` or `$20` to cover-up experiment.

DV: attitidues towards experiment. 

When you were in low resistance condition (20 bucks), vs high disonance condition (1 dollar). Were told to lie but with insufficient justification. Had to resolve the dissonance by thinking that they liked the experiment more. 

When you don't have sufficient justification and can't explain-away behaviour, then you change your cognition, internalizing it to match the behaviour. 

-
Self-perception theory (Bem)

We look to behaviour to explain our attidues. 

In this theory, participants observed how much they got paid and this is what dictated their attitudes.

Explains why intrinsic motivation can turn into extrinsic motivation. Over-justification effect: if you receive too much of an incentive for something, do the behaviour because of it, even if you enjoy it. Old man paying kids to play in his yard. 

-
Fazio

IV: created expectancy vs no expectancy for rewards

tested kids and their motivations to play with magic markers.

DV: time spent playing

Took a picture of kids playing with markers. Brought htem back into lab a few weeks later, gave them same magic markers, told them if they played they would receive reward. Also randomly allocated to priming previous attitudes or not. (pictures of playing with no extrinsic motivation) Would this attenuate over-justification effect?

When there was a low salience of initial attitudes (no pictures) they were demotivated. 

Support idea that people develop attitudes based on observing themselves. 

-
Zanna + Cooper

Demonstarted that that 1 vs 20 dollar case was a different mechanisms. 

Both theories make same prediction, different mechanisms. Getting paid \$20 makes you enjoy the activity less. 

-
Misattribution

Cooper and Zanna gave participants a pill (really a placebo) that they said would make them feel aroused. This would create a misattribution, and explain away why they might experience the tension/arousal.

IV: high or low choice situation (not induce cognitive dissonance)

IV: given a pill that was labeled arousal vs relaxation (or no pill as control)

When you could explain away arousal to the pill, the effect of dissonance disappeared. Even greater dissonance if given relaxtion pill. 

This is evidence against self-perception theory and supports the original idea of cognitive dissonance as an explanation for why beahviour -> attitudes. 

Doesn't mean self-perception is totally wrong. When we don't have well-formed attidues (where we cant have dissonance) we rely on behavioural cues to infer attitudes.
