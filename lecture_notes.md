# PSYCH 253

## Lecture 1 - Sep 9

Social psychology is the study of social thinking (how we perceive ourselves and others), social influence, and social relations.

### Information Processing Model

Goal-regulation theory. There are many models of human behaviour.

We are biased information processors.

### Theory of mind

Implied consequences of actions. You are able to infer that people around you also have minds and are sentient. Other beings have unobservable mental processes going on.

A _social brain_ is related to interpersonal interactions. Social animals demonstrate complex and large brain mass. 

Eg. chimpanzees can recognize intention.

Social behaviour is learned - we start as ego-centric individuals.

Children under the age of 3.5 fail perspective taking.

People with autism have a lack of social skills, perform poorly at perspective-taking tasks. (eg. with a picture of eyes, telling what they are expressing).

### Social Facilitation

Bike riders did better when in the presence of others. Triplett had people perform against others (simulated fish reeling)

Some individuals are faciliated by the presence of others. But some experienced inhibition of behaviour (nervous tension/anxiety)

Zajonc theorized that dominant responses are augmented by audiences.

Mere presence vs audience have different results.

Arousal and drive result in higher expression of dominant responses.

Yerkes-Dodson law: there is an optimum amount of arousal/drive.

Realistically everyone has their own arousal curve.
