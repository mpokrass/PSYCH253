# PSYCH 253

## Lecture 2 - Sep 9

Social psychology is the study of social thinking (how we perceive ourselves and others), social influence, and social relations.

### Information Processing Model

Goal-regulation theory. There are many models of human behaviour.

We are biased information processors.

### Theory of mind

Implied consequences of actions. You are able to infer that people around you also have minds and are sentient. Other beings have unobservable mental processes going on.

A _social brain_ is related to interpersonal interactions. Social animals demonstrate complex and large brain mass. 

Eg. chimpanzees can recognize intention.

Social behaviour is learned - we start as ego-centric individuals.

Children under the age of 3.5 fail perspective taking.

People with autism have a lack of social skills, perform poorly at perspective-taking tasks. (eg. with a picture of eyes, telling what they are expressing).

### Social Facilitation

Bike riders did better when in the presence of others. Triplett had people perform against others (simulated fish reeling)

Some individuals are faciliated by the presence of others. But some experienced inhibition of behaviour (nervous tension/anxiety)

Zajonc theorized that dominant responses are augmented by audiences.

Mere presence vs audience have different results.

Arousal and drive result in higher expression of dominant responses.

Yerkes-Dodson law: there is an optimum amount of arousal/drive.

Realistically everyone has their own arousal curve.

## Lecture 3 - sept 14

Where does self-concept/self-identity come from?

We use behaviours to extrapolate instances where we are good at different things and derive abstract representations - self-schemas. It becomes very ingrained, very core to us.

We often change our concept of self depending on our environment, who we interact with. 

We look to other people to evaluate ourselves. 

We use comparisons with other people when we are threatened with our identity/sense of self. We make downward comparisons to increase our mood.

We also make upwards social comparisons => negative mood. Sometimes though, if we have confidence in our own capabilities, looking upwards may not always end up in negative affective state. May be inspiring, if we feel like we could achieve this state.

Happiness moderates impact of social comparisons.

Had people to word unscrambles. Had people perform really fast or slow - makes an implicit social comparison. Test subjects also reported their own ability.

People with below average happiness were more affected by a faster peer. 

Another study: asked participants to create a puppet show with 2 puppets. In order to manipulate comparisons, they had a confederate perform the same tasks. The confederate always got one type of feedback. In the upwards comparison, subjects got got positive feedback, but they were still worse than the confederate. So positive feedback + upwards comparison. Measured changes in mood pre + post comparison. In the downwards comparison condition subjects got rated poorly, but confederate did even worse than them. 

Had happy + sad participants to start. __Look at slides for these result graphs__

In collectivistic cultures achievement is attained as a group, as opposed to individualistic western cultures.

Another study compared reward distributions of collectivists vs individualists. 

Independent variable: performance (high vs low) and anonymity (anonymous vs not)

DV: distribution of monetary rewards

Americans followed equity principle: i did more work so i deserve more.

Chinese followed equality principle, gave equal allocation regardless of work.

Difference disappeared when allocation was anonymous. Anonymity allowed people to lose identity (eg. lose collectivist identity)

Our self-knowledge isn't very objective. Impact bias and planning fallacy (in textbook). 

Impact bias - overrepresenting positive feelings from something, eg team winning or new iphone.

Planning fallacy - when you overrepresent the time we spend working on something. We think that we have laser focus into what our behaviour will be/our motivation. But we can't comprehend all of the extraneous behaviours that influence us. Their are situational influences that modify our behaviour.

Study: record how long we're going to be spending on 10 different activities. 24 different blanks - for each hour in the day, what they might be doing. 

DV: predect how you might feel if team won or lost football game (football fans).

Wins and losses are both mitigated (happier losing, less happy winning) because they see what else is part of their day. 

Another correlational study, observe fans feelings over losses. Very slight increased in baseline mood after loss (so many other things going on in their lives - pychological immune system). 

Same after winning, slight decrease in happiness actually. 

When no game, thanksgiving, high increase in happiness.

We experience feelings completely different to how we predict them. The way we predict them also affects how we experience them.

Another study, participants predicted their happiness and then gave an actual rating. When you add more details to your day, you realize that the impact of the football game is low. We have very poor introspective abilities. 

Another correlation study - what is people's dispositional level of happiness? Predict happiness after getting final grades, and then measure them. Had no correlation to how they actually felt. You think you're gonna feel a certain way - but it actually has no bearing on what you actually feel. 

## Lecture 4 - Sep 16

Poor access to our mental processes. Explicit vs implicit attitudes. Cognitive conscious thoughts, and automatic thoughts. No correlation between these two (explicit thought vs implicit association). 

People try to explain implicit thoughts but often get them very wrong. Implicit attitudes test. 

Social desirability bias - don't want to have these implicit associations. Spreading activation - adjacent neurons. Some of the concepts will be more closely associated than others. 

Self esteem is your attitude towards or evaluation of the self. Our self esteem is a socio-meter. Indicator of how well we are doing in our social environment. People are motivated to maintain high self esteem. 

Low self-esteem predicts aggression, anti-social behaviour, and deliquency. 

In the late 90s and early 2000s, psychologists wanted improve people's self esteem, eg. participation trophies. 

But narcissists (inflated self esteem) are agressive and anti social too. More likely to retaliate when threatened. Can become extremist. 

Study measured explicit vs implicit self esteem. People with explicit high self esteem actually had lower implicit self esteem. Donut people. Unstable sense of self. 

Explicit self esteem really doesn't mean much. 

Self-control is social. We inhibit primitive pre-potent inpulses for delayed rewards (willpower). Poor self-control predicts anti-social behaviour. 

Ego-depletion: exerting self-control reduces subsequent efforts. 

Taste perception: please don't eat 3 hours before. 

IV resist temptation to eat cookies (ate radishes) vs taste-test the cookies vs no food control group

Asked group 1 to not eat cookies (self control), group 2 let them eat cookies, group 3 no food.

DV: presistence at an impossible tracing task. Having eaten radishes and depleted self control, group 1 gave up on the task much before the other groups. 

Depleting self control resources. Argument that it is a self-fulfilling prophecy: beliefs and attitudes shape our behaviour. 

We balance our want-to and have-to selves. 

Another study: read different descriptions of willpower. group 1: willpower is limited and needs rest and recovery. group 2: exerting willpower can be energizing for other activities. 

Half of participants exerted self-control and half did a control task. Cross study, 4 groups. Willpower - cross out letter Es in a passage. Other study had specific Es to cross out. 
DV: performance at self-control task (stroop task).

Results showed that we don't really understand self control. People can be trained into it not depleting. (Like above study)

We fail at predicting the future self. Hyperbolic discounting. 100 now vs 120 in a week or 120 in a month vs 140 in 5 weeks. We have a bias for the present moment. People who get into debt. 

Self-serving bias: success = self vs failure = situation. This maintains our self-esteem. Eg. group projects: everyone thinks that they did more work. 

Theory of mind: able to perceive what other people are thinking. We present desirable images of ourselves. We feel less need to do impression management around friends. This is because the people around you know you already.

## Lecture 5 - Sep 19

Context matters - new and old cues in your environment will shape your actions. Social beliefs and judgements dictate how you perceive the situation and how you act in it. Our judgements and preconceptions are cued by out context. Can have implicit cues that prime different behaviours (don't even notice). 

We analyze our environment and make patterns/predictions. We later rely on these patterns, sometimes unconsciously. 

Priming - cognitive concepts can be activated through primes, influencing our behaviour. The brain is a collection of neural networks, activating one node can lead to "spreading actiation". 

Can we subconsciously prime and change behvaiours? 

IV: primed with concept of rude vs polite vs neutral. Completed a scrambled sentence task. 

DV: polite vs rude behaviour. Experimenter was stuck "explaining" the SST to confederate (timed how long it took participant to interrupt). (pulled into a room, experimenter was helping explain to confederate). Timed how long it would take them to interrupt. 

People who were primed with politeness interrupted significantly less, then neutral, then rude. 

Are social judgements related to behaviour; can they too be primed?

IV: primed with concept of elderly vs neutral (scrambled sentence task)

DV: gave debrief on study, then left. Timed how long took them to walk to elevator to leave. 

They thought people primed with elderly thoughts would be slower, and they were. Replicated this again in another study. This suggests that even without explicitly targeting a behaviour, the generalized stereotype was enough to cause the behaviour. 

We should be cognisant of all of the things that influence our behaviour. 

-
Can hostile behaviour be primed with an African-American stereotype. 

Subliminal vs supraliminal `!=` unconscious vs conscious. 

Conscious vs unconscious: can bring to the front of mind/working memory, vs not able to.

Subliminal: outside of conscious perceptual field. 

Faces shown subliminally during long, boring estimation task. Higher ecological validity. We might not ever be aware of these things. 

People who were primed with black faces were more hostile than those primed with caucasian faces. We can never be 100% aware of all of our biases. 

-

Patient with blindsight (had stroke in right side of brain, couldn't perceive the left side of the world). 

Showed patient pictures of houses and asked her to select her preference. One of the houses was on fire on the left side. 9/11 times she chose the non burning house. When the house was burning on the right side, she correctly chose the house. 

-
Schemas don't only affect current behaviour, but memories as well. Schemas drive our automatic associative behaviour. 

Misinformation effect: incorporating schema-congruent information resulting in false memories. This works because the misinformation _feels right_. Confidence doesn't always predict reality. 

-
Belief perserverance: people believe firmly in their judgements and are hard to persuade. 

People use strength over weight when evaluating confidence. Strength of their memories over weight. 

Strength: positive/warmth of a reference letter (eg. size of an effect)

Weight: credibility of the source (eg. sample size)

Flip a coin 5 times and it's all heads: strength is high, weight is low. 

IV: presented with 12 coin=spinning scenarios. Bias of 60% but not sure where it's biased to.

DV: asked people which way they thought it was skewed. 

People over-guessed how likely it was. s

Testimonials work well because the strength is high. 

-
Hyperbolic discounting: as things get further in time, they get more similar. We value the present moment much more. 

## Lecture 6 - Sep 21

Confirmation bias: we focus on evidence that supports, rather than falsifies our intuitions. We don't look for stuff that is against our views. Look for info that confirms our beleifs, no matter how weak it is.

-
IV: difficulty of passage stimulus (disfluency). Presented in hard to read font.

DV: stance on capital punishment (controlling for political ideology). 

-
The reasons we utilize conf bias is because we make use of heuristics. They are mental shortcuts, save our cognitive capacity. Lets us save executive function for more important things.

We store schemas instead of memories. Our brains are very efficient. 

Availability heuristic: recent/available information biases our judgements. 

Representativeness heuristic: our mental schemas or representations colour our intuitive judgements. 

These biases typically work for us, but in some situations they fail us. 

-
Illusory correlation: two distinct events become linked; increased attention to rare events.

Illusory control: gambling; individuals believe they have influence on the outcome. 

More likely to react with negative reinforcement.

-
Tested the idea of "paired distinctiveness".

We are likely to associate events together.

IV: read about group a or group b individuals. 

39 statements more positive (27) than negative (12) statements (9:4)
26 in group a, 13 in group b (2:1)

DV: accuracy in recalling behaviours, estimates of typical traits of group members.

Individuals over-estimated the likelihood that group b had negative traits, inaccurately recalled more negative behaviours. 

-
counter factual thinking

Hypothetical scenarios with alternative outcomes that "almost" happened.

Can be near misses (downward) or (upward) in nature.

Purposes for this type of thinking?

- suggested that we use it for affective reasons
- also for preparation for future events (avoid some negative result, therefore motivational)

-
Attribution theory

We perceived behaviour in terms of "causes" (recall theory of mind)

Fundamental attribution error: we lack information, more likely to attribute behaviour to internal (vs external)

Dispositional attribution vs situational attribution. Have more insight to the reasons behind your actions. We have more leeway for our own actions. 

-
Ross et al. study 1

Participants brought into a lab for a quiz game experiment, no confederates.

IV: experimental vs control condition

- experimental: questioner developed hard questions for contestants (q will know answer, reflective of intelligence)
- control: questioner asked pre-selected questions for contestant (q may not know answer)

DV: self ratings of knowledge, and partner's knowledge.

E: contestants rated questioner as smarter, own intelligence rated as about average
C: contestants rated questioner as less smart, themselves as more smart

-
Study 2

Replication of study 1 except participants are observers, everyone else is a confederate.

Watched questioner come up with 10 questions, and contestant had to answer.

DV: ratings of knowledge of questioner and contestants.

- q mean knowledge: 82
- c mean knowledge: 40

Summary: we are more prone to attribute to disposition rather than situation. 

Study 2, even stronger effect. Demonstrates actor-observer bias. Lack of insight into perspective of actor and under-valuing influence of social environment. 

-
Self fulfilling prophecy: 

Partipants given role of an interview

IV: white vs black confederate

DV: video taped and measured social cues towards to confederate

Differential treatment of black and white confederates. Both confederates trained to act/answer in same ways.

Interviewers sat further away from black confederates. 

-
Will interviewer behaviour influence performance?

Flipped, confederates were interviewers.

IV: more vs less positive social cues (eg. longer interview, closer distance, verbal errors)

DV: interview performance rated by observers

Results as expected. 

## Lecture 7 - Sep 23

Social situation derives your identity. 

Slacktivism. 

Sometimes we have specific attitudes towards a behaviour that we don't follow through on. We don't necessarily follow through on our intentions. 

Attitudes have an evaluative component. We think about mental objects, and evaluate them in some way. They are ingrained in our memories. Part of the attitudes are implicit.

We also have affective, behavioural, and cognitive consequences. Dual attitudes - implicit vs explicit. Work together to predict our behaviour. 

When your attitudes are primed in your mind/strongly represented, then you are more likely to act in accordance with your attitudes. 

-
Study, participants completed go/no go task. Presented with specific stimuli, press a button in response, or not press button. Respond to odd numbers, withhold when given letters.

IV: experimental group develop a specific plan to respond to a number vs control group spent time looking over stimuli. 

Developing specific attitudes and intentions leads to better attitude-behaviour consistency. 

Potent attitudes -> behaviours.

Being inconsistent with our attitudes creates a type of tension. Drawing attention to self-awareness will improve attitude-behaviour congruency. (Cognitive dissonance)

-
Participants come into lab for a "teaching" experiment. 

Pre-screened individuals for punishment attitudes. Private: I believe that the use of physical punishment could never be considered right.

Public: most people believe that the use of physical punishment could never be considered right.

When attitudes become more salient will make you more likely to be consistent with attitudes.

IV: control vs eye level mirror vs audience (public norms) vs audience (no public norms)

PArticpants had to teach confederate a list of words, shock them every time they made a mistake.

Eye level mirror to induce self awareness, or audience watching, or audience but they weren't evaluating the individual. Hyp: audience evaluating has more of an effect on self awareness than audience not evaluating. 

case 1: only selected people with lower condoning of punishment. These people shocked less than control. Attitudes became stronger predictor. When alone, less consistent with attitudes.

(people who believed in punishment). When they were made self aware, more likely to punish.

Private attitudes -> behaviour when self-aware using a mirror

-
Theory of planned behaviour.

Behaviour having recursive effect, bi-directional relationship. 

Some actors, in order to get into the mindset, they live their lives that way to think and believe in the same way as that character. Doing a certain behaviour can affect our thoughts and attitudes. 

-
Stanford prison experiment. Everyone's behaviour became very extreme, stopped experiment early. 

## Lecture 8 - Sep 26

20 m/c from textbook readings

theme of the course - based on understanding of social psych, not concerned with names/dates. 

-
Harmon Jones study

Do behaviours increase commitment and change attitudes?

IV: made a difficult (more similar choices) vs easy decision (choose easy thing vs hard thing)

DV: measured attitudes towards decision. 

After you make a decisional commitment to one choice, you start to dislike the other one more, even if liked it more before decision. 

Other examples: foot in the door, saying becomes believing, lowball technique. 

What are the mechanisms behind this?

Might help us cope with the fact that we are forced to do something. 

Cognitive dissonance, Self-presentation, self perception.

Want to present a consistent self to the world. Don't want to perform a behaviour and say you are doing something else. 

We like to resolve our cognitive tension and align our behaviours and thoughts. 

Self-perception: when our attitudes aren't formed yet. We perform behaviours without knowing why, and observe it, and then come up with reasons as to why. 

-
Self-presentation

We don't want to look like liars. Want to show the world that we are consistent in terms of thoughts and behaviours. If i lose my favourite glasses - I didn't like those glasses anyways. 

Tice study - does our public self-image affect how much our attitudes change following behaviour?

Partipants were told to portray a trait during an assessment interview (even if they didn't have it).

IV: public vs privately demonstrated (one-way mirror)

- emotional stabillity
- emotional responsiveness

Did behaving this way (private vs public) influence people's attitudes? 

Cross study: either stability/responsiveness, either private/public. So 4 cases. 

Control was athleticism, so extra 2 cases. 

Hypothesis: public presentation changes.

DV: self-ratings of portrayed trait.

Talked on intercom to grad student (public) or recording answers (private). 

After completing interview questions - rate their own traits that they were asked to exhibit.

Those asked to be stable rated themselves as more stable, and vice versa. 

Evidence for self-presentation theory. Present/change attitudes when in a public setting.

In control, self ratings (scale 0-25) were more average (12-13)

All the particpants knew they were being told to act this way, but still internalized it as their disposition. 

Tice - study 2:

replicated study 1 and extended it to see if self-presented behaviour -> attitude -> behaviour.

IV: introverted vs extroverted

IV: public vs private

DV: measured self-ratings

DV: how far they sat away from confederate, how many conversations they initiated with confederate

results:

- self rating in extraversion was lower in those told to be introverted, sat further away from research confederate

We are not changing attitude just for world to see, it also affects our behaviour. Makes our behaviour congruent with actions. 

Self presentation plays a key role in shifting our attitudes following behaviour. 

We want to create a consistent image of ourselves. 

-
Self justification; cognitive dissonance

We don't want to look/feel like liars. Want our behaviour to match our attitudes.

Conflicting, inconsistent cognitions create tensions. Reduce dissonance by adjusting our thinking and our attitudes (instead of behaviour). 

Changing the behaviour isn't possible because you did it already, can only change cognition. 

Explaining away our behaviour to make our cognitions make sense. Can't undo the behaviour. 

-
Study: hour long boring peg-turning task. 

Then asked to tell another "participant" that it was fun. How do we resolve this conflict? 

IV: paid either `$1` or `$20` to cover-up experiment.

DV: attitidues towards experiment. 

When you were in low resistance condition (20 bucks), vs high disonance condition (1 dollar). Were told to lie but with insufficient justification. Had to resolve the dissonance by thinking that they liked the experiment more. 

When you don't have sufficient justification and can't explain-away behaviour, then you change your cognition, internalizing it to match the behaviour. 

-
Self-perception theory (Bem)

We look to behaviour to explain our attidues. 

In this theory, participants observed how much they got paid and this is what dictated their attitudes.

Explains why intrinsic motivation can turn into extrinsic motivation. Over-justification effect: if you receive too much of an incentive for something, do the behaviour because of it, even if you enjoy it. Old man paying kids to play in his yard. 

-
Fazio

IV: created expectancy vs no expectancy for rewards

tested kids and their motivations to play with magic markers.

DV: time spent playing

Took a picture of kids playing with markers. Brought htem back into lab a few weeks later, gave them same magic markers, told them if they played they would receive reward. Also randomly allocated to priming previous attitudes or not. (pictures of playing with no extrinsic motivation) Would this attenuate over-justification effect?

When there was a low salience of initial attitudes (no pictures) they were demotivated. 

Support idea that people develop attitudes based on observing themselves. 

-
Zanna + Cooper

Demonstarted that that 1 vs 20 dollar case was a different mechanisms. 

Both theories make same prediction, different mechanisms. Getting paid \$20 makes you enjoy the activity less. 

-
Misattribution

Cooper and Zanna gave participants a pill (really a placebo) that they said would make them feel aroused. This would create a misattribution, and explain away why they might experience the tension/arousal.

IV: high or low choice situation (not induce cognitive dissonance)

IV: given a pill that was labeled arousal vs relaxation (or no pill as control)

When you could explain away arousal to the pill, the effect of dissonance disappeared. Even greater dissonance if given relaxtion pill. 

This is evidence against self-perception theory and supports the original idea of cognitive dissonance as an explanation for why beahviour -> attitudes. 

Doesn't mean self-perception is totally wrong. When we don't have well-formed attidues (where we cant have dissonance) we rely on behavioural cues to infer attitudes. 

## Lecture 9 - Sep 30

Internal (self-perception, self presentation, dissonance) vs external (convincing argument, new knowledge, inception: the idea seems to be internally driven, persistence, foot in the door, credibility of person) sources of attitude change 

- no hard and fast rules for persuasion, individual differences make us more susceptible to certain arguments. 

Central vs peripheral rules.

- central: facts, actual reasons
- peripheral: other aspects of our attitudes. implicit automatic associations

Central route processing leads to stronger attitude changes, involves processing of core ideas. Requires motivated audience, difficult and effortful. 

Peripheral route processing relies on cues that are not directly tied to the message content. Affective feelings towards the message/speaker. Complexity of the argument, perceived expertise of the speaker. 

Can never describe a smell to somebody, so cologne/perfume adds use peripheral routes. There's no content, can't accurately portray that the smell is better. Can't make the info available.  

Not as long lasting attitude change. 

-
Chaiken

How and when do we process peripheral or central cues?

IV: high vs low processing of the message (ie. relevance) (consequences)

IV: peripheral cue: likeable vs not likeable message souce (insulted vs praised undergraduates in an interview transcript)

IV: central cue (message contained 6 vs 2 arguments)

Peripheral cue: chose likeable vs unlikeable speaker's point. Highly influenced about the cue. Not having to think deeply about the subject makes you not think deeply about the content. 

Central cue: more influenced by central cues. 

When issue is relevant, we are persuaded by central cues (strength of argument)

When it's not an important issue, peripheral cues (likeability) more strongly influences attitudes. 

-
Patzer

Does attractiveness increase credibility?

Participants rated their attitudes towards a fictional pain relief medication that was endorsed by a person (picture) that varied in attractiveness. 84 pictures accross 120 participants, rated on attractiveness.

Studied trustworthiness, expertise, liking. Most attractive people had highest scores in all. Being shown no photo is better than being shown a bad photo of some person (ugly). 

We judge these things based on attrativeness, no effects or interactions with gender.

Why is this?
Stereotype beauty = good. Evolutionary advantage, symmetry = more healthy. 

Advertisers utilize this with celebrity endorsements. The hot people on adds seem more trustworthy, expert. 

-
Reason vs emotion

Edwards

Do persuasive appeals need to match their attitude scores?

Eg. getting very sore after first time exercising. 

Manipulated attitudes towards Chinese characters. Looked at tpeople's changes in attitudes towards characters pre and post manipulation.

IV: source of attitude,

- subliminally flashed a face, then viewed a character, then read about it, then viewed it
- viewed character, read about it, subliminally flashed a face, then viewed a character, 

Also I: given either an emotioal appeal, or cognitive appeal

DV: change in liking of character, confidence in judgement

Negatively affected the thoughts. 

Type of emotional change, or cognitive attitude change message. 

2 happy: 2 angry. Each one has affect based and cognition based. 

When you base your attidue on cognition, have to change it using cognition.

Have to match how they formed the attitude with how the attitude will be changed. 

Attitude changes as a result of both, but stronger effect when you match the method.

summary: subliminal and suprialiminal persuasion both seem to change attitudes. Matching the attitude source is key in maximizing persuasion.

-
Uncertainty and Persuasion

When they have more strength, more likely to be affected by their persuasion. 

Incongruence (conflicting ideas) generates stronger attitudes because it creates more central processing. Put more attention into what's going on. Behavioural inhibition system (BIS) notices incongruencies and directs attention there - increases central processing in those fields. 

Propaganda vs education: propaganda is 1 sided, no uncertainty. 

Expert sources that exhibit certainty in their opinions and attitudes do not violate our expectations (no further elaboration)

Accordingly, non-expert sources should demonstrate uncertainty. Not a lot of experience in the topic. 

-
Karmarkar + Tormala

Does conflicting source and certainty chars increase persuasion?


IV: source expertise: food critic vs network admin

IV: level of certainty, definitive rating vs wishy washy rating

DV: ratings of attitudes on restaurants

Non expert source + high certainty changed attitudes the most. 

Experts + low certainty changed attitudes more than high certainty. 

We imagine expert to always give us strong definitive results, When they give us uncertain results, makes us think about the message more, makes us accept it more. Primed central route processing, more invested in the review, paid more attention to it. Incongruency increased central processing.

Non-expert source, when opposite happens, very sure of attitude, really catches our attention as well. 

Expert sources that are uncertain are most persuasive.

Also non-expert certain.

Lots of individual differences in persuasion. 

## Lecture 10 - Oct 3

Persuasion depends on central vs peripheral routes.

Trump and wall is persuasion based on peripheral routes, based on speaker.

Credibility can be based on attractiveness. 

Matching attitudes - must be changed through the same route. 

Message channel: once the source and message are chosen, how do we decide how to convey it?

Effect of the audience: msg must be well-received and accepted by the recipient. 

-
Message channel: how the message is communicated

Central vs peripheral. 

Face to face vs written. 

-
det Wit et al

In person, can get more information. Messages are provided with more vivid detail and can be more persuasive. Greater attitude changes.

IV: message of increased HBV risk (hep b)

- personal account: narrative, first-person story
- statistical evidence: matched passage (in length)
- mere assertion: single statement suggesting male-male sexual relations increases risk
- control: no statements

DV: mean scores regarding risk perception

Some evidence for the idea that narrative personal accounts can have greater attitudinal changes. 

Individuals in the narrative condition demonstrated highest risk perceptions and intentions to get vaccinated. 

Statistically significant risk mediation.

-
Bickart and Schindler

How does online (media vs personal influence) information affect consumer behaviour?

IV: students researched one of 5 categories (biking, exercise equipment, supplements, photography, stereo equipment)

IV: corproate websites vs forums

DV: measured intentions to purchase items, knowledge on topics, thoughts and interest in those topics

People showed significantly more interest in product when reading on forums. 

Summary: personalized information vs mass media appeals are more effective. Not controlled for content. 

Reduced perceptions of bias. Central route (written with more thought, demonstrate individualization). Possible empathy and vividness of message. 

-
Message framing eample

Messages can be written to emphasize losses or gains.  People are attentive to negatively or positively framed messages: negative information is undesirable. 

-
Smith and Petty

How do people respond to positively or negatively framed message.

IV: negative or positive framed message

- negative: no recycling will elad to landfill use (already x% full)
- positive: recycling will reduce landfill use (x% full)

IV: weak or storng arguments

- weak: 25%
- strong: 75%

DV: agreement with message, thoughts listed related to recycling

Negative framing: people were more attentive to the strength of the argument. 

Negatively framed info is more attended to, people are less convinced by weaker arguments. More likely to think deeply about negative messages. 

Is this due to expectation?

-
Study 2, smith and petty

If we expect positive messages, do we more carefully read negative frames? 

IV: negative or positive

- negative: not taking vitamin k increases risk of heart disease by x%
- positive: taking k reduces heart disease risk by x% 

IV: weak or strong:

- 0.1% vs 10%

DV: effectiveness of message

Unexpected information draws your attention more (not just negative info). 

Summary: particpants expecting information (positive or negative) were unaffected by argument strength. However receiving a message that violates expectation is more salient. 

-
Two step process of media

We are all influenced by the media, directly and indirectly. 

People in our social netowrk (on and offline) influence our attitudes. 

Audience characteristics. Not all messages fall on the same set of ears. 

Marketing researches tailor messages to our characteristics. Some individuals are more easiliy persuaded than others

-
Hirsch et al

Do ads work better when tailored to personality?

IV: received a message based on big-5 personality trait

- 5 ads of different phones with captions aimed to each of B5
- eg extraversion: with the phone A you'll always be where the excitement is
- eg neuroticism: stay safe and secure with the phone b

Significant positive correlation with how the advertising worked and correlation with b5 traits. 

Emphasizes that messages should target the audience and be tailored accordingly. 

Resisting persuasion

Counter arguments: key to resisting attitude change, solidifies our initial attitudes. Coutner arguments only work to increase attitudes if we believe our arguments were wrong. gotta believe em

## Lecture 11 - Oct 5

What is conformity?

"Yielding to group pressures"

Eg. everyone goes to university, marriage, children. Why do we follow things because they are "convention"?

-
Sherif

How do we develop social norms?

Ambiguous stimulus used to develop artificial norm. Autokinetic effect (stationary light in dark room appears to move)

IV: confederate vs alone

IV: norm distance induced (ranging from 3-8 inches - 7 conditions)

DV: self-reported perceived distance over 50 trials, verbal estimate of average, reported influence of confederate

Reported that the norm was around 8 inches. Also aware that the other individual seemed to influence some of his decisions. 

Participants changed their estimates to match the experimentally induced norm. Carried over to 'alone' trials. 

Not all particpants were aware of external influence. 

-
Transmission of norms

Culture and traditions, people follow a set of rules/behaviours that we adopt from our social environment (eg. greetings, eye contact)

Why is this the case? What is the adaptive function of cultural norms?

harmony, acceptance, 

-
Whiten

Trained chimps to acquire food using a tool

IV: poke method vs lift method vs control

DV: adoption of behaviour among the group

Individuals taught a method were more likely to use it. 

Demonstrated methods to other chimps; evidence for social learning. 

-
Asch

How does group pressure influence our judgement?

IV: in a group (2-15 confederates) vs alone

DV: correct estimates in a judgement task. Estimate which one of 3 lines was most matched to standard line

When confederates were all selecting the wrong line, person did so more. 

Summary: we are strongly influenced by the ones around us, we comply and conform despite our better judgement to fit in.

Outward compliance vs private acceptance (internalization).

Don't necessarily believe the choice you are making. 

-
Goldstein et al

How does group pressure (in the form of social norms) influence towel re-use behaviour?

Observed client towel usage in 60 days

IV: emphasized how reusing towels was beneficial and norm based (standard environmental vs norm based)

DV: how much towels were reused

More reuse when norm based arguments. 

study 2

How does specific group pressure affect this normative influence?

IV: change the workding of each message to emphasize different social identities. 

Specific targeted messages induced behaviour more. 

Normative pressures are more effective than appeals to values in changing behaviour. Specific normative pressures most effective. 

-
Milgram

Shock people when told to by someone with "authority"

How willingly obedient are people? What promotes compliance?

Told study was about memory and punishment.

Participant given a sample shock. 

Learner in seperate room for participant. Polled a panel of experts when tehy thought people would stop, they all thought 135 volts (strong shock).

Always underestimate power of situation. 

Obtained behaviour much higher than estimate. 

Milgram manipulated immediacy of victim (proximity)

IV: other room and not heard and seen (until 300 volts) vs learner's protests could be heard (but not seen) vs same room as learner vs after 150 volts, participant had to force their hand onto the shock plate

DV: compliance (protest against the experimenter)

More protest when people are closer together. 

Removing experimenter from room dropped compliance to 30%

## Lecture 12 - Oct 7

We are sensitive to our social environment, conform to societal rules and regulations. 

Conformity: upholding social norms, maintaining collective behaviour. Degrees of conformity, not all behaviour compliance is equally weighted. 

Other societies exist where their norms are different

Naturalistic fallacy: we assume if people do things that are deviant from the norm, that is strange and bad. Just because it's the norm doesn't mean things "should" be that way. 

Proximal explanation: the direct effects of a behaviour, provides are superficial analysis of the purpose (the how)

There is general group pressure to fit in (normative influence)

We lack information and utilize others to help us make sense of the situation (situational influence)

These are reasons why you conform. 

Those able to socially conform demonstarte greater neutral self-control capacity. 

Group-related decison making is also related to greater frontal lobe activity. 

-
Debono et al (study 1)

Does self-control capacity affect conformity to social norms, specifically injunctive norms?

Injunctive norms - societal pressure (generalized), not everyone necesarily adheres too. Eg. shouldn't be on facebook during classs. Pressure to maintain how things should be. Generalized social pressures. 

Used Baumeister's two task paradigm. Depletion model of self control. 

IV: deplted vs non-depleted:

- typing paragraph task had to inhibit an impulsive response (dep: could not press e or space key, non dep: type everthing)

IV: anon vs identified. 

Adding anonymity makes someone less likely to conform. Don't suffer repercussions of social backlash. 

DV: number of difficult GRE analytical puzzles solved, cheating (binary), amount of time spent completing the tasks (after it was supposed to be done - cheating). Impossible tasks - reporting completed is cheating.

Anonymous and depleted individuals cheated most. 

-
Study 2

Norms that everyone does (descriptive norms) eg driving on right side of road, facing forward in lecture hall. 

IV: same typing task: depletion vs non depletion

DV: # times participant said 'thank you', also a binary variable of how the experimenter thoughtt ehy were nice. Experimenters blind to study.

More polite behaviour in people who weren't depleted.

Self control ability predicts conformity to social norms. Emphasizes the social nature of social control. 

Study 1: exerting self control resulted in more cheating

Study 2: exerting self control predicted less polite behaviour

-
Conformity; distal explanations

Public goods game: an experimental task where individuals can either co-operate for larger group rewards or defect for larger individual rewards. 

Everyone puts in 10 bucks, there is a multiplier, everyone gets slightly more.

If one person doesn't put any money in, they still get more given back to him. Eg. everyone 15 vs everyone 11.25 except one guy with 21.25

-
Adreoni and Petrie

How does idenficication influence conformity in a PGG?

IV: level of identification

- baseline: no info
- photo of participant
- information regarding contribution
- photo and information

When you're given the most identifiable information, most social compliance. 

Being identifiable increases conformity and contributions ot social good. Punishment towards defectors (lose social value)

Modelling behaviour by other individuals. 

-
Susceptibility to conformity

There are situational influences that increase conformity. 

The more people around you, the more likely you are to conform (group size) 

Informational influence - unaware of what's normal in the situation (lack of knowledge)

Personality characteristics (Agreeableness)

Social norms and culture

-
Darley

Does fear influence susceptibility to conformity?

IV: fear vs no fear. Told they would receive an electric shock after the trial to test their inner ear (induces fear)

IV: group similarity (made to believe that 3 other subjects (confederates) were also in the same condition, or they were in opposite condition)

2x2 experiment conditions

DV: conformity and agreement. How many metronome beats there are.

Fear and group similarity had highest conformity. 

Just fear also induced conformity. (Fear and no group)

Fear anticipation induces conformity.

-
Non-conformity

Why do we strive to be unique?

- Ego (social identity)
- Can represent desirable traits to the opposite sex
- informative of personality, attitudes, etc

-
Griskevicius stuy 1

How does self presentation affect our motivation to conform?

IV: different priming conditions

- self protection (fear) scenario prime
- romantic scenario/attracting a mate prime
- no passage control
- neutral passage control

DV: rating of abstract painting (conformity with confederates)

Fear prime - all more likely than control to conform. 

Attractive mate priming - men didn't conform. represenation of how dominant they are, independent. Men didn't conform in the negative condition, individuals rating the abstract painting well (group pressure was to rate it poorly). Representing a positive mindset in the men. Men less likely to be susceptible to group pressures of negativity. 

-
Study 2

When is an ideal situation for nonconformity?

IV: roantic mating prime vs control

DV: conformity

Objectivity to which answer was correct. 

Conformed less, wanted to be more correct. Seem more attractive to other mates.

Men - doinance

women - agreableness

## Lecture 13 - Oct 14

Moral Licensing, justifying our conformity.

We are motivated to maintain a high-self esteem (sociometer theory), it is an indicator of social value. When we perform immoral behaviours, we don't internalize them, we try to justify them. 

Do people ever consider themselves to be immoral?

Before reprehensible conduct, moral justification and palliative comparison (eg. stealing < killing), euphemistic labeling.

Leads to detrimental effects. Minimizing, ignoring, or misconstruing the consequences.

If there is a victim, dehumanization, attribution of blame. 

Also displacement of responsibility, diffusion of responsibility (eg. millgram exepriment, blame on experimenters)

-
Vincent et al

Do happy people engage in more moral disengagement?

IV: positive or neutral mood

- recall a life experience that was positive or neutral

DV: moral disengagement scale. (sometimes people deserve crimes against them, etc)

Result: people with more positive affect, agreed with stealing/lying in certain situations. More moral flexibility.

-
Study 2

Does this moral disengagement lead to immoral behaviour?

IV: 

- positive (vs. neutral) mood; induced using a cartoon clip vs screensaver
- self-awareness (high vs low); using a mirror

DV:
 
- moral disengagement
- stealing behaviour; participants completed a difficult arithmetic task and paid themselves based on performance. Each correct problem, got 50 cents for. Compared how many solved vs how much money they took.

People with high self awareness were less likely to steal money.

People with low self awareness were more likely to steal. Even stronger for poisitive affect and low self awareness more likely to steal. 

Positive affect: more likely to endorse negative behaviours, and perform them.

Behaviour is predicted by their attitudes. 

-
Social facilitation

Social presence facilitates behaviours.

-
Sympathetic-adrenal-medullary system

Quick acting system, acts out of PNS. Activates adrenal glands, epinephrine.

After the stressor is active for a longer period of time, then hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. 

-
Taylor et al

Do supportive vs unsupportive audiences result in stress?

IV: participants performed the trier social stress test (TSST) in varying audience conditions

- no audience
- supportive
- unsupportive

Measures salivary cortisol, heart rate. baseline, during task, recovery (within-subjects)

DV: physiological stress; heart rate, systolic blood pressure, salivary cortisol

Result: More stress during task. Positive condition had highest increase in salivary cortisol (even more than negative, though negative was higher than control).

-
Social loafing

Opposite of social facilitation. When engaged in group and working towards a goal, might slack a little. Reduce effort based on diffusion of responsibility. Less likely to internalize tasks on self and expect to complete them on own.

Expectations on group as a whole, rather than on self. Benefit from the effort of others. 

-
Fishbach et al

How do we increase goal participation?

Partipants assisted in a focus group. Came up with 10 slogans for a cell phone.

IV: identification with the group

- high: focus group of same Korean university
- low: other Korean universities 

IV: framing of the task progress

- accumulated: 50% done
- remaining: 50% remaining

DV: social loafing: number of ideas

Socially distant others: when 50% done come up with more.

Socially close: when 50% remaining come up with more. 

-
Fishbach study 2

What is the mechanism in these effects?

Told to come up with 50 promotional ideas for a cereal bar

IV: identification with group. Same university vs other universities

IV: framing of task progress. 24 done or 26 to go.

DV: ideas generated, perceived goal value and progress

Goal valuation predicted by group identification and framing.

Random others, contribute more when accumulated.

Socially close: contribute more when remaining.

If the goal is meaningful, will not socailly loaf.

Socially close others generally more ideas in both conditions, less social loafing. 

If you don't care about the goal will socially loaf (for the people who are not within a social group).

-
Fishbach study 3

Does these effects apply to real world settings?

PArticipants asked to contact friends to spread awareness of earthquake in Haiti. Teamed up with a group of 5 others to contact 50

IV: measured level of identification with group

IV: framing of progress: 24 done, 26 to go

DV: number of friends contacted. 

Result: high identification condition were more motivated when 26 left, rather than 24 done. Perceived goal progress dictates whether or not we socially loaf in high identification.

Low identification: low engagement in both conditions.

Participants low in identification benefit from thinking about accumulated progress. Knowing how much has been done boosts motivation as it increases valuation of the goal, but effects did not transfer to the real world (study 3).

## Lecture 14 - Oct 17

Pluralistic ignorance - bystander effect. Use people for social cues, their inability to act causes you to misinterpret the situation.

Deindividuation - loss of self awareness. When we lose self awareness, we no longer retain social norms/standards and out behaviour changes as a result. We perceive ourselves as individuals. Consequence of this is disinhibited behaviour. Less self control. More self-disclosure on the internet, a lot more anonymity. Unsupervised children were more likely to take more candy because couldn't be identified. More impulsive tendencies, lack of self control and executive functioning. When you remove yourself from a social environment, more likely to perform disinhibited behaviours that are antisocial in nature.

We can feel deindividuated when in large groups (riots) or music festivals (mosh pits). Youtube comments, mean tweets. People give into their impulses when no identifying info. In a lot of situations, become more aggressive, unless prosocial cues.

Deinviduation leads to disinhibition. Simple concrete behaviours in unison in a large group, stealing of conformity, loss of slef. Eg. marching in large group, consuming alcohol. Eg. welcome week cheering. 

-
Worchel and Andreoli

Do we individuate other people advantageously?

Teacher/learner.

Individuation information; name, personality, physical characteristics, habits, background, mottos

Deindividuation information; age, hometown, race, present residence, political party, religion

IV: affect (as learner)

- angry (negative feedback)
- not angry (positive feedback)

IV: feedback behaviour (as teacher)

- shock
- reward
- nothing, just record

IV: recall (this condition is less important)

- before feedback behaviour
- after feedback behaviour

DV: deindividuation of target (how much info they remembered)

Result: when participants had to shock targets, were more likely to deindividuate the learner. Don't want to create realistic depiction of person, don't want to think of them as a person. Congruent to Millgram's proximity to person being punished. Mirror neurons that fire when you observe pain. The more individuation you give to someone (also details) you also experience their pain. So when they knew they were going to shock people, less incidence on identifying information.

Result: when angry (form of disinhibited information), less likely to pay attention to individual in terms of specific information, more deindividuation.

People with positive feedback less likely to deindividuate when told they were going to give positive feedback. 

Rewarding behaviour increases recall of individuating information. Less likely to add vivid details to person. Converse when we anticipate aggression. 

Eg. sports events: us vs them, prepares us for competitive/aggressive behaviour. Situations of moral licensing (de-humanization). Also when focused on selfish gains, anarchy, us vs the man. 

-
Pluralistic ignorance

Why do people wait until the end of class to ask prof questions?

We use our social environment to gain information. 

Sometimes this backfired, leads to pluralistic ignorance. Eg. no one is asking questions because they all get the concept - but other students thinking same thing, no one wants to be judged. Assume everyone else understands concepts. 

-
Prentice and Miller

Pluralistic ignorance towards alcohol consumption. 

It's not the norm to drink in a reserved manner. 

Asked students their opinion on alcohol consumption habits at the university (princeton)

Said their habits and avg students habits

IV: self vs others' comfort/endorsement with alcohol habits

- self vs average (Study 1)
- self vs average vs friend (Study 2)

People's overall acceptance of drinking was below midpoint. People don't really endorse heavy drinking. Thought that average student endorsed it.

Over estimate everyone's endorsement of alcohol. Everyone is conforming to this norm regarding excessive drinking. 

Same effect in study 2. Avg > friend > self. Didn't endorse as much as avg student, but more likely to support culture of excessive drinking. 

This indicates pluralistic consumption. 

Study 3: do these perceptions eventually lead to attitude change? Will you eventually follow the norm?

Telephone interviews of students, 2 times during semester

IV: self vs others' comfort with alcohol habits

- self vs avg
- 2 time points (within subjects)

DV: rating of comfort

Women less likely to endorse norm + change attitudes and behaiours. Women more or less maintained refute of this norm.

Men changed their attitudes to better match what the social norm was. Believe in the culture and follow along with the norms. 

Males more likely to internalize perceived group norms and adjust attitudes towards these norms. Femalses resisted attitude change.

Author say that this may be biased, because men might be more predisposed to alcohol consumption norms than others. 

Individuals can mispredict feelings/attidues of their peers and follow along with norm that may be unreliable. 

-
Shelton and Richeson

7 studies that demonstrated that people mistakenly believe racial outgroups are disinterested in social interactions.

study 2:

Can pluralistic ignorance explain intergroup relations?

Participants imagined entering a dining hall and rated their interest in sitting with (white or black) students

IV: white vs black

IV: self vs others' rating (within-subjects)

DV: interest in interaction

White individuals rated black individuals a bit over average (outgroup). When asked to rate what that group thought of them, rated low interest (black people didn't want to sit with them much). 

Participant misperceived norms. Believed outgroup race less interested in contact. Perceived lack of interest is in reality due to fear of rejection.

Studies 5 and 6:

IV: fear of rejection vs lack of interest

IV: self vs others' ratings

DV: magnitude of ratings and interaction with outgroup

Result: people very afraid of being rejected by other social group, perceived lack of interest for them to integrate with self. Outgroup had the same thoughts as well. Disarity of information transfer. 

Own fear of rejection negatively predicted contact with outgroup. Interaction with ingroup, more likely to associate with ingroup if fear of rejection with outgroup. Higher intragroup contact less likely to interact with intergroup. 

Summary: we make assumptions which lead to pluralistic ingorance when misperceiving intergroup relations.

-
Groupthink

Large groups elicit strong conformity which can overcome rational thinking and assessment. People conform because they are misinformed and going along with crowd. 

The larger the group is, the larger the group consensus, the larger the drive to conform is. More likely to face large-scale ridicule if you don't conform. Leads to group polarization, risky shift. No one wants to argue position, becomes magnified, more extreme, people less likely to dissent. 

## Oct 19

Darwin and the Galapagos finches

Lot of stark similarities in physical/anatomical shape. Are they actually different species? Maybe there's a common factor that connects these animals together.

Beaks had developed in a way to become more adaptive to the environment they lived in. Phenotype that different was size and shape of beak. Adapted beak for the kind of food they ate. 

-
Altruism: exhibiting helping behaviour without any need or reciprocity. 

Is there really such a thing? Selfish genes survive - survival of the fittest. 

Supported by comparative psychology (cross-species study) as well as neurisocience. 

Inclusive fitness; organisms that successfully pass on their genes are the ones that perpetuated. 

Other factors, not just whether individual lives or dies.

Eg. meercats, their group will forage for different foods. Certain meercats sacrifice their own well being (act as sentries) and watch for predators. 

-
Hamilton's rule

We might help if ` rb - c > 0 ` where r = relatedness, b = benefit, c = cost

We are more altruitistic when we are related to people. Kin selection

In some situations, we help people who are unrelated to us. Eg. dog nursing tiger puppies. 

If there's no benefit to altruism, it will eventually get selected out. Traits that are useless would be phased out.

So there must be some sort of benefit to altruism. 

We feel indebted to people who are altruistic to us. Might push us to return the favour. (direct reciprocity)

Indirect reciprocity

-
Direct Reciprocity

Repeated interactions predict greater cooperation.

Public goods game - reductionist view of social environment. Psotive benefits if everyone contributes to public good. Make most money if you cooperate. If you are a defector, you make money from those who put it into the pool. Simplistic view of what cooperation can produce, and situations where you can increase/decrease cooperation. _Distal explanation_ of social behaviour. Conflict between high individual gains vs collective group gains

Prisoner's dilemma = simplified version. Both confess = long sentence, only one confess, 0 sentence for the one that confesses. If both silent, smallest sentence. Safest to always give up information, in this case. Staying quiet is the socially acceptable thing to do, but tattling is the most self serving, but less good for the group as a whole. 

-
Komorita study 1

Do people demonstrate altruism in a direct reciprocity scenario?

Group decision making game, no identifiable info, two options: co-operate or defect

IV:

a) 3 real people
b) 2 real people, 1 programmed with tit for tat (TFT) strategy for one of the two players
c) one real player, one programmed to cooperate on trial 1, then TFT for rest, the other defects on trial 1, then TFT for the rest

TFT, copy what you just did

DV: percent of cooperation

In (c), effective to cooperate with peers, cooperate more.

-
Komorita Study 2

What if the group size increases and randomness is introduced?

5 person group

IV: condition

a) 5 real people
b) 1 real person, 4 random
c) 1 real, 4 programmed, 1 did TFT, 1 did TFT with first program, 2 did random responding (overall 33% cooperation)
d) 1 real person, 4 programmed; same as above, except the last two (not random, did majority decision)

Result: Highest level of cooperation in condition d

There was a general baseline of cooperation.

-
Indirect Reciprocity

Helping other people might bring status, reputation. Displaying traits that you are a cooperative individual, other people may come to my aid. Indirect benefits through reputation or alternative related actor. 

-
Hardy and Van Vugt Study 1

High schoolers played PGG in groups of 3 (66 total)

\$1.75 to personal vs joint pool, only 2 rounds

Indirect benefits to being the biggest giver. 

IV: reputation vs no reputation (identifiable)

IV: round 1 vs round 2 (within subjects)

DV: percentage of cooperation

When you are identifiable, cooperate more in the 2nd round. 

More they donated, higher overall perceived status by other 2 participants. People who offered the most money had the lowest resources at the end of the game. There is a cost to altruism.

-
Study 3

Is reputation and altruism a dose-response relationship?

Watched a PGG game, 4 players were allocated seperate resources (\$10 or \$5)

IV: perceived altruism

a) got 10, gave 5
b) got 5, gave 5
c) got 10, gave 1
d) got 5, gave 1

Highest status for b, lowest for c.

## Oct 21

Hardy and Van Vugt Study 1

Will having reputation increase altruistic behaviour? (reciprocity theory)

High school students participated in the PGG in groups of 3 (total 66). 

(sidenote: prisoner's dilemma is only 2 choices, in PGG many options b/c can give any amount of money, gives a continuous measure). 

Asked participants to distribute $1.75 to personal vs joint pool, only 2 rounds, some particpants given identifying feedback after round 1

IV: reputation vs no reputation (anonymity)

IV: round 1 vs 2 (within subjects)

DV: percentage of co-operation, perceived status of partners

Result: Motivated to give more money when there was identifiying info. 

In reputation round, second round increase in co-operation. 

Also asked about status of people (eg. how likely would you be to ask them to be the leader of another group), results were amplified by how much they contributed to the group fund. 

-
Study 3

Is reputation and altruism a dose-response relationship? If you derive a reputation for how much you give, will you receive a proportional gain in reputation based on how much you give?

Watched a simulated PGG (they were confederates). 4 players were allocated resources (either \$10 or \$5)

IV: perceived altruism

a) high resources/high contribution (got 10, gave 5)

b) low resources/high contribution (got 5, gave 5)

c) high resources/low contribution (got 10 gave 1)

d) low resources/low contribution (got 5 gave 1)

DV: perceived status of partners, partner selected for a second game

Result: perceived status was dependent on relative amounts they gave. Highest status for (b),  lowest status for (c). 

(b) > (a) > (d) > (c) 

There are benefits from altruistic that aren't always tangible, can earn social benefits (eg. status). Altruism reputation relationship is relative and depends on individual situations. 

-
Empathy

If you feel empathy, when observing someone in distress then you are motivated to minimize their distress (altruism in an effort to minimize those feelings). Some have suggested we are altruistic because of empathy. 

-
Mirror Neurons

Neurons that become active when observing another individual AND when performing a behaviour oneself. Effective in empathy. We experience it as if we are doing it ourselves, similar structure. 

Some propose this to be a primitive form of theory of mind. 

-
Rizzolatti (don't need to memorize this)

Testing idea of mirror neurons. Recorded electrical activity in visuomotor neurons in macaque monkeys. Demonstrated behaviours for monkeys to observe. Had monkeys repeat behaviour.

Activity in specific neuron was related to both observation and action. 

Mirror neurons in areas of sensation-perception are active when viewing others' emotions. Strong connections to amygdala, other emotional centers of the brain. 

Mechanism for motivated, altruistic behaviour. We feel what we see and are motivated to reduce those feelings and act on them in some way. 

-
Classic helping studies

When do we help? Kitty Genovese got stabbed in front of 37 people and no one did anything. Why? Did people become deindividuated? 

-
Darley and Latane

Participant was in individual cubicle "having a discussion over an intercom". Played the taped conversation to all participants. 

Discuessed personal problems in a 1-1 manner. One "Participant" talked about an issue with having seizures. Told that only one person can speak at a time. 

In the middle of seizure discussion, person makes seizure sounds, then goes completely silent. Experimenter isn't in room, see what participant does. 

IV: perceived group size (2, 3, or 6)

Beleieved that theere was:

- just the other person
- 3 people in total
- 6 people in total

DV: time it took to get help from experimenter.

Result: when participant alone, helped 85% of the time. As group size increased, less and less likely to help the individual. Mirrored by time to help. Less time to help the smaller the group size was. Idea of diffusion of responsibility. Knew other people were listening, assumed someone else would help. Social loafing and conformity; people aren't doing anything becasue don't take on the effort. Aslo pluralistic ignorance. 

-
Study 2

Actual people this time. Participant waited in a room (either alone, with confederates or 2 other participants) for a study to begin and filled out questionnaires. The room slowly started to fill with smoke from a wall vent (began to obscure vision).

How long would it take people to respond?

Confederate would just look at the smoke, shrug it off and not respond. Pressure to not react to the situation and keep working on questionnaire. Eventually smoke filled up the room and obscured vision.

IV: 

- alone
- particpant and 3 confederates that were passive and ignored the smoke (pressure to conform)
- 3 actual participants all naive to the purposes of the study and unacquainted with each other

DV: Time it took to notify the experimenter

Result: notifying experimenter: Alone 75% > 3 participants 40% > condition 2 10% (explained away some reasons). 

-
Latane and Rhodin

Participants completed a "market research study"

Experimenter explained study and then said she would be working in the room next door (collapsible door). She shuffled for several minutes, then played an audio recording with noises that siggested she had climbed a chair and something fell on her ankle, then complained about her ankle. "Damsel in distress" idea, someone is clearly hurt, unlike smoke situations.

IV:

- alone
- participant and a passive confederate
- 2 actual participants that were strangers
- 2 participants that were friends

DV: percentage of people taking action

Result: 1 ~ 4 > 3 > 2

## Oct 24

Lots of aggression on the internet. Deindividuation/anonymity in cars and online. 

Physical and verbal behaviour intended to hurt someone. Hostile vs instrumental aggression. 

Hostile - reaction to the environment, hot-tempered, reactionary aggression

Instrumental - planned and used for some other purpose (eg. terror attacks) 

Has kind of been debunked though (false dichotomy)

Aggression is defined as a response that delivers nexious stimuli to another organism. The term attack can be used as a synonym. 

Negative affect derived from somebody slighting you. Lack of self control can affect aggression. Moral licensing, deindividuation. Narcissism (low implicit, high explicit self esteem). 

-
People with impaired prefrontal cortex activity show increased aggression. 

Executive functioning is used for self-control and inhibits impulses.

Cranial current stimulation (activating prefrontal cortex) can reduce incidence of aggression.

Prefrtontal cortex is youngest development of brain (evolutionarily new). Instinct towards aggressive actions, but we've developed this structure to inhibit/control it.

Social behaviour (in general) requires self control. We've developed this structure to inhibit the response. 

Left frontal assymetry is correlated with aggression (also with reward behaviours, suggesting that anger is in some way rewarding). Eg. stubbing toe, venting anger. Anger is rewarding and feels good, but we use outer brain structures to inhibit these. Don't always want to be reaping hedonic rewards, for social benefit.

-
Frustration aggression hypothesis

Dollert et al

Frustration always leads to an aggressive response. 

For behaviours we expect a particular outcome, when that outcome is not met then we experience frustration. Original hypothesis formed in relation to goal achievement. Want to perform noxious behavior in some way. 

-
Relative deprivation and aggression

Lyuboomirsky and ross

Social context matters (upwards and downward social comparisons)

When individuals experience inequality compared to their peers, it results in more violent crimes. (inequality aversion). Not absolute deprivation, absolute. 

Blacks relative feeling of injustice predicted militant behaviour. 

Supports the idea of "goal expectation", where failure to meet that expectation leads to aggression. 

Self-control has been associated with social behaviour. Both neural indicators and self-report measures. Also supports our claim that anger is anti-social. 

anger seems to be a primitive instinct coming from lower level areas of the brain. 

-
DeWall et al study 1

Does exerting self-control increase aggressive behaviour?

Participants asked to write an essay about abortion and rate their own food preferences. Completed with a confederate in another room, gave feedback on the other person's essay.

Performed a "taste test", given a donut (or radish) but just before eating it, told to stop

Experimenter returns 5 minutes later and gives feedback from partenr (negative ratings) as well as a profile of their partner's food preferences (disliked spicy)

Asked to administer a taste test of chips to partner

IV: depletion vs no depletion (resist eating donut or radish)

(all got bad feedback)

DV: how much hot sauce they decided to administer

Result: people who were depleted gave more hot sauce to the confederate. Didn't report more anger, just aggressive behaviour. 

-
Study 2

Another essay writing task with a "partner" evaluator

Essay about abortion (5 minutes) and then watched a 6 minute video with no audio that had sitracting text

measures of mood (with frustration added)

given feedback on essay (positive or negative)

IV: depletion vs not (had to resist reading words, annoying subtitles)

IV: negative vs positive feedback

DV: length/intensity of annoying noise blast

Result: no singificant difference in self-reported frustration. 

Result: more aggressive behaviours when negative feedback. Most aggression when provocation and depleted. Being provoked in some way - natural response is aggression. We divorce that capability (because of social norms) when we are not depleted. 

Summary: exerting self-control alone does not lead to frustration/aggression (study 2). Being given negative feedback in addition to self control depletion resulted in more aggression. 

-
Aggression and apology

We aren't always aggressive eg. if the situation suggests it was unintentional. If you can't blame the frustration on something - no anger, nowhere to aim it. 

Apologies reduced feelings of anger and aggression. If people are able to repent/show remorse, convey internal mental state, supporting social connection and offering more social information. We are less able to deindividuate. Mitigates fundamental attribution error. 

-
Struthers et al

Does apology always lead to forgiveness and reduce aggression? Doesn't always feel sincere. 

Participants completed a group work and communication task with a partner. Read a section of psychology textbook and answer 10 questions. Confederate (un)inentionally hit a joystick they were told not to touch which deleted all the answers. 

IV: intention (disregard experimenter) vs no intention (accident while reaching for something)

IV: apology vs none 

DV: forgiveness rating, liking of confederate rating, and number of ballots entered for \$50 draw. 

Result: 

- accident: apologizing increased forgiveness behaviour. 
- intended: no significant differences in forgiveness based on apology. 

More ballots = forgiviness. 

-
Struthers et al Study 2

Comunity sample of workers, read about a work scenario where them and a coworker had to meet a deadline.

Failed to meet the deadline (because of co-woker) and had to forfeit a cash bonus and promotion.

Then overheard a phone call between co-worker and spouse where they either intedned to (or did not) miss deadline.

Participants then read about either receiving an apology or not. 

IV: intention vs not

IV: apology vs not

DV: effect of apology. TRIM

People were more forgiving if apology + no intent. If there was no intent, apology doesn't help much. 

Summary: apologies used to increase forgiveness (pro social behaviour). TRIM (transgression responsE)

Apology sincerity plays a role in effectiveness. 

## Oct 26

People with more self control have more forgiveness propensity. 

Frustration does not always lead to aggression. Too simple, behaviourist perspective. People control their aggressive tendencies. 

Anger and frustration can be aimed at an unrealted target (displacement). 

Instrumental aggression, but useless dichotomy. 

Displacement resulted in the catharsis hypothesis; release of anger should eliminate aggressive tendencies.

Study found that reading pro (vs anti) catharsis message lead to increased aggressive behaviour. 

The brain; spreading activation network and learning theory predicts higher aggression with catharsis (learn that anger is good in the situation). Practicing aggression will only further solidify the relationship in the brain. 

-
Violence-related media

Hypothesis: Always seeing or practicing violence on TV increases aggression.

Viewing more violent material desentitizes or habituates us. We are less disturbed by more extreme material. 

Social learning theory (bandura): we look to other individuals to shape our own behaviour. Acts as a model of aggressive behaviours. Kids play with sticks that look like guns; media shapes their neural system to find these cues acceptable. 

Longitudinal correlational evidence supports the idea that violent media -> more violent behaviour. 

-
We respond to our environment unconsciously. Aggressive cues are no different, also prime our behaviour. 

Berkowitz "sometimes the trigger pulls the finger" - our environment can shape us.

Aggressive cues are important; not just frustartion -> aggression, people select aggression when its adaptive. 

-
Berkowitz and lepage

Participants were involved in a learning study testing stress responses. Come up with ways a publicist can increase popularity of an artist. Then read another partner's topic and administered shocks.

Idea was evaluated using shocks (1=good, 7=bad)

When participants administered shocks, were different cues near the machine.

will having weapons (env cues) increase aggression?

IV: angry vs not (got more shocks, 7 vs 1)

IV: weapons (relevant) vs weapons (peripheral) vs no objects vs control objects

Womens were described as belonging to the other participant, or as left over from a previous experiment in the room. More attention to relevant cues. 

DV: number of shocks given

result: No significant difference between relevant and peripheral cue. However weapons induced more shocks (only when angry)

People are subconsciously affected by environmental cues (all denied influence of the weapons on behaviour). Weapons increased number of shocks given and shock length.

Gun ownership regulations - fewer aggressive primes in Canada than US. 

-
Consequences of aggression

Aggression is anti-social; it damages social relationships but is it always bad? Eg. mom protecting cubs

People use aggression "adaptively" in ways to influence social relationships. An avenue for altruism is that people socially exclude those unwilling to conform and contribute to collective good.

There are also personal consequences of experiencing and performing aggression. What happens to the actor following aggression?

-
fischer and roseman study 1

How is anger and contempt utilized in a social context?

Anger: very direct

Contempt: indirect anger, disparages the other person, ignores them, etc. Don't seem to offer any benefit, so exclude from social circle. 

Participants recalled an event where the experienced anger vs contempt, then rated a series of statements

IV: anger vs contempt

DV: self perceived ratings of anger/contempt

result: people who remembered anger reacted with anger more, people who remembered contempt reacted with contempt more. 

People who recalled anger rated that they were more intimately related to the object of anger. More verbal confrontation for anger. 

More derogation/exclusion for contempt. 

More coercive when angry, try to change their behaviour. 

More perception of being in control when angry. 

-
Study 3

Do anger and contempt responses differ based on closeness?

Imagined a scenario; coming home late on public transit and drunken friend (vs stranger) aggressively insults them, then rated similar statments to study 1

IV: friend vs stranger doing the verbal attacking

DV: self perceived ratings

result: People felt same rating of contempt for friend and stranger.

People were less angry towards a stranger, could distance themselves more easily. More likely to verbally attack friend, derogate stranger. More likely to coerce the friend. Excluded the stranger more. 

More reconciliation with friend. More rejection towards stranger. More control with friend. 

Social exclusion is very passive aggressive. 

"The social function of anger can be conceptualized as attaining a better outcome by forcing a change in another person's behaviour."

People get angry in close relationships but not distant ones. 

Suggests that people use anger to get what they want because it changes our perception of the scenario. 

-
Keltner et al

Participants read a vignette meant to induce sad or angry emotions, then read another story about being romantically "lead on" by someone (frustration).

IV: sad vs angry vd neutral (imagined mom suddenly died vs negative feedback in public setting from TA unfairly vs international businesses)

DV: rating of other scenario

Result: 

- anger: see event as the fault of the other person
- sad: maybe realize that there was a misunderstanding, not that the other person was "out to get" them. See situation as hopeless. 

People in angry condition focus on a specific scenario and express anger at the person that slighted them. In sad condition try to distance themselves.

-
Keltner et al

Do people feel more personal vs situational agency when angry vs sad?

Personal agency - have control over the event that occurred, you are the related actor. 

Situational agency - understand that outside circumstances caused the situation. 

Participants told it was an experiement on imagining hypothetical events, read the same vignettes as before as well as 2 that primed personal and situational agency.

IV: angry vs sad vs personal vs situational

DV: rate the likelihood that an event occurs.

Result: anger is related to agency and control over environment. Sadness causes focus on situational agency. 

Anger generates a sense of control, primes us to act and change situation.

## Oct 28

(not on midterm)

Individual social processes

Social situations influence our own cognitions and behaviour. social beliefs, persuasion, conformity, group influence, altruism, aggression

Our brains are programmed to make us inherently social (eg. mirror neurons, theory of mind). 

Groupthink - make decisions as a group, no longer an individual influence. Social situations can influence a collective group. 

Can group people into students, athletes, etc. Descriptions of self because you have a social identity. Way that you perceive yourself personally (privately) but also a characterization socially.

-
Group social processes

How do we define groups? Those that are similar to us:

- physical similarity = kin selection theory
- value and goal similarity = group selection/network reciprocity

The ingroup bias: even when we think of our 'group' we are egocentric.

Also egocentric when we are young. 

Minimal group paradihm.

Study where people are shown a bunch of dots and told to estimate. Told that 'you fall into the category of over estimators, and there is another group of underestimators'

Following the feedback, in 2nd part of experiment, given a set of rewards. You are not included in the group, but preferrentially divide resources to 'your' group even though you do not benefit. You are affiliated with the group, they might reciprocate. 

-
Prejudice

the ingroup bias sometimes leads to prejudice.

Prejudgements about a group of people that leads to overgeneralizations and discriminatory behaviour. 

Eg. the homeless and needy; lazy dependents on social programs? drug addicts? Why don't they go get a job?

Eg. mental illness and weight stigmas. We might attribute personality factors to people with different body types. overweight = lazy, thin = bitchy

Heuristics that we follow

Why do we maintain these unfair judgements towards groups of people?

Belief in a just world. People have _agency_ which makes us believe people are deserving of their situations. You have control over your environment. If these people are in bad circumstances, they did it to themselves. Believe the world is fair and just. 

Makes us believe that people are deserving of the situations they are in.

Randomnness and uncertainty is aversive/uncomfortable; it impairs action. People don't want to belive that they are in their circumstance because of randomness. To truly accept that the world is constanty random, you're not deserving of the things that you have - can crush self esteem, lose feeling of control, agency. We cognitively avoid this thought, create a framework that makes sense: effort you put in comes back equivalently. 

Having a sense of justice and belief in a fair world drives us to maintain prejudice. System justification theory (psych 350). Mostly people with conservative values like structure/order; most susceptible to threats/uncertainty. 

-
Another cause for prejudice is group comparisons. We perform social comparisons at different levels; ingroups and outgroups are a macro level social comparison. 

We want to boost our self esteem by having a valuable, unique and desirable ingroups (compared to the outgroup). Eg basking in reflected glory. When team won 'we won', when lost 'they lost'. Preferential language to connect/remove yourself from groups associated with social identity. 

Group serving bias: same as self serving bias, motivated to believe that our group is the best or better than others. 

Realistic group conflict theory: we are competing for limited resource and developed innate dislike/competition with outgroups. 

-
Sherif

Young boys 9-10 went to a state park, had them stay at the park in different bases.

2 phases:

1. groups don't know about eachothers existenct, playing, developing group cohesion
2. introduced to other group, couldn't play because other group was fighting for the same resources

Boys started to become competitive/prejudices. Fighting over shared resources. Until the groups were brought into a problem they couldn't tackle individually, they had to work together. This eliminated the conflict with the outgroup. 

-
Personality, beliefs and attitudes; social dominance orientation and authoritarian personalities. (effort begets rewards, punish those who perform poorly)

-
Sexism: unfair judgements based on sex. 

Glass ceiling: cap on how much women can make in comparison to men. (same position)

Sexual harassment: we still objectify women, but is it really our fault?

-
Chivalry perpetuates gender stereotypes.

Benevolent sexism (see psych 350 notes)

- protective paternalism: women need men's protection
- complementary gender difference; purity
- heterosexual intimacy; men need women to be truly happy

These ideas lead to benevolent sexism, preferrential treatment. 

-
Becker and Wright (study 1)

Does benevolent sexism reduce women's intentions to take collective action?

Participants completed a memory study, read 6 sentences and answered questions that 'may or may not be' related. 

IV: benevelont sexism vs hostile sexism vs gender neutral vs gender unrelated

DV: ratings on collective actions intentions and cognitions/beliefs

- action: i would participate in a rally for gender eqality
- cognition: gender specific system justification, perceived advantages of being a woman

Result: benevolent sexism - less likely to participate in rally

-
Study 2

Does benolvent sexism reduce actual behaviour as well?

Same as study 1, then given an unrelated task of taking/giving out flyers and signing a petition (supporting women's rights or autonomy for students)

IV: smae 4 cognitions

DV: same cognitions and collective action behaviour

Result:

- bs: less likely to take flyers and sign petition
- hs: more likely

Participants all women

-
Study 3 and 4

Does changing gender-specific system justification and perceived advantages lead to changes in collective action?

## Oct 31

Developing and using stereotypic information is easier and requires less cognitive effort. Reduce cognitive load using broad categories (spreading activation networks). 

Low prejudice individuals exert effortful self-control toward their reactions to outgroups. 

Media supports stereotypes and further maintains them. Similar to violence in the media and learned aggression. 

As a result, stereotypes are implicitly stored and can become activated when there is insufficient cognitive effort. Eg. IAT

Low prejudice individuals primed with a negative stereotype prior to evaluation give more negative ratings. 

Must be cognitively aware of behaviour at all times. 

Outgroup homogeneity vs ingroup heterogeneity. We don't analyze outgroup people traits very much until it's goal relevant (ingroup). Spend cognitive effort to get to know them.

You notice how different people are when they are in your ingroup, not as much in outgroup. 

We naturally perceive outgroups as undifferentiated, meanwhile ingroups are very diverse (similar to aggression and deindividuation). More easy to aggress when we deindividuate.

Own race; can percieve differences in own race faces, we generally have most exposure to our own race.

Similar to a learned skill, experience increases attention to subtle, specific, and detailed cues (rather than abstract categories). We can do the same with identifying outgroups. 

The cultural mosaic model in Canada works to overcome prejudice and stereotypes. Exposure to multiple cultures develops experience and leads to these learning counter-sterotypic information. Over time, the inconsistent information that is more readily encoded individuating outgroups.

Inconsistency is centrally processed and more presuasive. 

-
Illusory Correlation

Two distinct events are coupled leading to development of stereotypes. 

Study: Group B is minority vs Group A and negative behaviours are more rare than positive. Proprotions same in each group (eg. 3:1). Associating one rare occurrence with another. 

-
Memory biases

Memory is a dynamic process of storage and retreival. We encode unique inconsistent memory better, so then why do steretypes exist? Under cognitive load, we retreive this information more slowly than stereotype consistent information. 

-
Cognitively maintaining prejudice

Low prejudice: normally not prejudiced but failure of cognitive machinery leads to endorsing/maintaining stereotypes.

High prejudice: facing counter-stereotypic information they tend to explain away the observations (eg. an exceptional or unique case, luck or chance, motivation or effort, situtaional pressure). 

We infer cause and effect; cause is generally associated with human action. 

Why are high prejudiced people defensive? They are unaccepting of counter-stereotype information because it threatens their worldview. (system justification) Social dominance orientation people, strong authoritative personalities. Accept less randomness, novel, inconsistent info. 

-
Linguistic Bias

Stereotypes are subtly spread through our language and descriptions. People used generalized and abstract wording when observing sterotypic events of the outgroup. (Eg. Jamal is being aggressive). 

-
Bartholew et al study 1

How does alcohol affect stereotypes and biased responses? Participants asked to complete a study on alcohol and person perception. Measured stereotype activitation; being primed with arace should increase accessibility of stereotype words. Mixed with "house" primes and related words.

IV: alcohol dosage (high vs low vs none/placebo)

IV: person prime: white or black

DV: RT judging stereotypic traits (eg. lazy, pretentious) as "person-related"

Found no effects for alcohol; didn't change whether stereotypes were activated. Primes were the main effect. Black prime, more black stereotypical trait categorization. White prime, more white stereotypic trait association. Quicker to react when congruent prime + trait.

-
Study 2

Does alcohol change inhibition response?

Similar design to study 1 (primed and reacted to stereotype traits) however the tack was further modified to have a go or stop signal. Have to stop self in responding based on signal. Effortful self control. 

IV: alcohol dosage

IV: person prime; white vs black

IV: go or stop signal

DV: RT judging stereotypic traits (eg. lazy, pretentious) as "person-related"

Result: People who had alcohol were most likely to make inhibition errors in the stereotypic consistent condition. More likely to become stereotypical when under the influence of alcohol, harder to inhibit gut reactions. 

-
Summary: 

The perceptual changes related to alcohol does not affect stereotype activation, but does affect inhibition (poor). Intoxicated individuals more prejudiced because of poor cognitive control.

-
Turner et al study 2

How does intergroup contact influence prejudice?

White/asian secondary school students rated their interaction with the outgroup. 

Correlational design/self report.

Extended contact improves outgroup interactions.

Measured opportunity for contact, number of cross-group friendships, extended friendship.

Outcomes: intergroup anxiety, self-disclosure, implicit and explicit attitudes.

More asian people in immediate surroundings makes you have more friendships with asian people, less intergroup anxiety, more likely to disclose life characteristics with them. 

-
Study 4 (he said probably will not be tested)

What effect does self-disclosure have on the in/outgroups?

Participants (white undergrads) participated in this correlational study on integroup relations.

Result: having more friends who are of outgroup caused you to disclose more information about self, increased empathy, trust, weighted importance of them in your life, and outgroup attitudes. 

Summary: increasing exposure to other races is correlated to more positive interactions with outgroups. 

Supports Canada's 'cultural mosaic model', higher exposure reduces prejudice. More time to connect and learn about outgroups (theory of mind).

## Nov 1 - Review session

Elaboration likelihood model - people become persuaded through central and peripheral route. Peripheral route relies on cues that are not directly tied to message content.

Chaiken: how and when do we process peripheral or central cues?

IV: high vs low processing of the message (relevance)

- high: told have to discuss argument later. have to know this later on
- low: will be discussing something different later - skim it

Iv: peripheral cue (likeable vs unlikeable message source, insulted vs preiased undergraduates)

IV: central cue (message containted 2 vs 6 arguments)

2^3 = 8 conditions

DV: opinion on the topic/attidue change

Result: 

- If high relevance, pay attention to central cues. More arguments are more persuasive. More likely to be convinced by the strength of an argument. 
- When low consequences all are peripherally processing the message. When peripherally processing, more convinced by a likeability cue than unlikeability cue (positive vs negative peripheral cues). Low educated people who don't care about politics have no knowledge about politics, are more swayed by likeability.  

Summary: when issue is relevant - persuaded by central cues, when unimportant then use peripheral cues.

-
Patzer

Does attractiveness increase credibility?

Participants rated their attitudes towards a fictional pain relief medication that was endorsed by a person (picture) that varied in attractivness 

IV: attractivness

DV: measures of trustworthitness, perceived expertise, and liking

Result: Attractive people were most highly related in all. 

Summary: we judge trustworthiness and expertise based on attractivness. "beautiful is good" stereotype

Eg. celebrity advertising

-
Edwards

Do persuasive appeals need to match their attitude sources? Emotional vs rational

Manipulated attitudes towards Chinese characters (contrived)

- based attitudes on cognition or affect using informational passages and subliminal primes

Looked at people's change in attitudes towards characters pre and post manipulation (ie. persuasion). Crossed with positive vs negative emotions. More relevant is emotion vs rational.

IV: source of attitude

- subliminally flashed a face first -> viewed character -> read about it -> viewed it
- viewed -> read -> flashed -> viewed

IV: given either an emotional appeal or cognitive appeal (opposite of what you were initially induced to feel)

4 condition study. Rate after first part and then second part.

DV: attitude change

Result: when you match the modality/form the attitude was formed, then more likely to persuade. If attitude developed based on affect, more changed based on affective approach. 

Summary: matching persuasive message with way the attitude was formulated maximizes persuasion. As well, both subliminal and supraliminal persuasion seem to change attitutdes. 

-
Karmarkar and Tormala

Does conflicting source and certainty characteristics increase persuasion?

More convinced by message from conflicting source.

If perceived expert gives uncertain information, then confusing to you. 

IV: source expertise (food critic vs network admin)

IV: level of certainty (definite vs wishy washy)

DV: rating of attitudes towards restaurant, cognitive elaboration of the review

Result: 

- non expert source: when high certainty then very persuasive. 
- expert source: high certainty is less persuasion. Low certainty is higher persuasion than high certainty. 

Summary: uncertain experts are most persuasive. Certain non experts are also persuasive. 

-
de Wit et al

Mesages that are more vivid in detail are more persuasive and result in greater attitude change. (why personal accounts are more effective than written). 

IV: message of increased HBV risk (hepatitis b)

- personal account; narrative, 1st person
- statistic evidence
- mere assertion: single statement suggesting male male sexual relations increases risk
- control: no statements

DV: self perceived risk of HBV, intention to get vaccinated

Result: Narrative evidence vs mere assertion only had statistically significant difference. However trend for narrative accounts being more convincing than the others.

-
Bickart and Schindler

How does online informaiton affect consumer behaviour?

IV: students researched one of 5 categories

- bicycling, exercise equipment, nutritional supplements

IV: assigned to look at corp sites vs forums

DV: measured intention to purchase, thoughts on product

Result: more interest in product when reading forums vs corporate web page

Another measure of attitdue persuasion. Personal accounts -> more interest. 

Further support that personalized messages vs mass media appeals more effective. 

-
Message framing:

Can be written to emphasize losses or gains. People are more attentive to negatively framed info.


Choose between 2 treatements for 600 people affected:

- treatement A: predict to result in 200 saved lives
- treatement b: predicted to save 33% of lives

-
Smith and Petty

IV: negative or positive frame (recycling will lead to reduce landfill, or not recycling will increase landfill)

IV: weak vs strong arguments: landfills are 25% vs 75% full. More central processing for more strong argument

DV: agreement with message, thoughts listed related to recycling

Result: negatively framed messages only convinced when strong argument (centrally processed). 

Negative frame is read more carefully. 

-
Study 2

Is this due to expectation? We usually expect positively framed messages, do we more carefully read negative frames?

Conflicting information increases attention to the info. 

Manipulated if people were expecting positive/negative frames.

IV: negative or positive framed message (not taking vitamin K increases risk, taking vitamin K decreases risk)

IV: weak or strong arguments (0.1% risk, 10% risk)

When expecting positive frame and received negative frame: more carefully processed message, only convinced by strong argument.

When expecting negative frame (eg. title = "risks of not taking vitamin k") and positive frame (eg. taking vitamin k decreases risk) then more attention.

If expect negative and receive negative, then gloss over.

If expect positive and receive positive, still slightly more affected by strong argument. 

When frame expectation is violated, we attend to the message more.

To convince someone with a weak positive message, frame as a positive message. Just as convinced. Given a weak positive message and expecting positive = convinced. 

Carefully read message when expectation violated.

-
Audience characteristics

People respond to messages in different ways due to personality characteristics. 

-
Hirsh et al 

Do advertisements work better when tailored to personality

IV: received a message based on big 5 personality trait (eg. extraversion = excitement, neuroticism = safety)

DV: rating of the advertisement, liking of the product, interest in purchasing it.

Result: When advertising frame matches personality, more effective, more convinced of message. 

-

Asch

judging line length equality. 

Sherif vs asch difference: don't know what's going on vs do, you perceive the others as wrong. Normative influence - going along with group for the sake of going along with it, have your own information and know what's going on, know which line is correct. Sherif - informational influence, don't know what's going on, can't actually tell. Go along with group because they seem to know what's going on.

At 4 people continuously conform. 

Outwards compliance vs private acceptance. 

-
Milgram

-
Proximal vs distal

Proximal explanation: the direct effects of a behaviour, provides a superficial analysis of the purpose (the how). Basic/biological cellular level. How the function works. Eg. my frontal cortex inhibits a lot of my primitive actions

Distal explanation: an evolutionary account of behaviour, explains the ultimate adaptive function. Bigger reason why something happens. Why the function is beneficial.
Eg. why self control is evolutionary adaptive

-
Debono Study 1

does self control affect conformity to social norms, specifucally injunctive norms?

IV: depleted vs not (typing task)

IV: anon or identified

DV: cheating behaviour (# puzzles said solved)

When depleted, more likely to cheat

-
Study 2

IV: same typing task

DV: number of times participant said thank you

depletion -> less thank yous, politeness. 

-

Distal explanations: public goods game. However much is contributed is multiplied by X and redistributed. If antisocial, end up with more resources. If everyone helps then everyone benefits. 

-
Andreoni and Petrie

How does idenfication influence conformity in a PGG?

IV: level of identification

DV: overall level of participation

Result: more identifiable, more likely to contribute. 

-
Asch: when participant can answer privately, more likely to not conform

-
Darley

IV: fear vs no fear (told they would receive a shock to inner ear)

IV: group similarity

DV: conformity and agreement

Main result: high fear more likely to conform to group behaviour 

-
When we perform immoral behaviours (don't conform to group norm) you can give yourself moral licesnsing for why you can deviate from the norm. Come up with moral justifications, palliative comparisons (at least i'm not killing somebody). Minimize/ignore consequences. Dehumanization, attribution of blame on the victim.
3 phases 

Self serving bias. 

## Nov 4

Stereotype content model 

When we develop group interactions, we cognitively partition people, based on 2 fundamental dimensions: warmth and competence. Emotionally connected to and capable.

Asch - evidence for core qualities.

Intelligent, skillful, industrious, _warm_, determined, practical, cautious

vs

Intelligent, skillful, industrious, _cold_, determined, practical, cautious

Drastically different interpretations by changing only this one key personality trait (changing other qualities did not have as dramatic effects). 

Maybe because the other traits are more narrow, industrious is a very specific trait. Fundamental perceptions associated with more broad, abstract terms. 

Factor analysis on traits. Distilled into four qualities - intellectual (good vs bad) and social (good vs bad).

-
SCM; ambivalence

People can have ambivalent attitudes towards different stereotypes. Can simultaneously hold a negative and positive view of somebody. We usually don't only hate the outgroup, can also attribute positive qualities to them (on these orthoganal dimensions)

Warm and incompetent; disrespected but pitied. Eg. old people, people with down's syndrome, spinal cord injury patients. 

Cold and competent; envied but lack desirable affiliation. Eg. asian people, extremely industrious and productive. Perceive them as colder, career-oriented women, jews, professors (?). 

-
Can also have univalent stereotypes. 

Although prejudice in an extreme sense still does exist today; that is people carry purely negative evaluations (on both dimensions)

Cold and incompetnet; contempt, disgust, and hate. 

Distance yourself, they almost have no redeeming qualities. No desire to associate with them.

Volountarily homelessness/social assistance due to laziness, drug addics (people with control and causality over their lives who make no effort). Extreme conservatives believe homosexuality is a choice, then very negative view towards people with AIDS (?)

Usually our purely positive evaluations are reserved for the ingroup. Warm and competent; admiration and pride. Ingroup or default reference group (the majority). 

-
Warmth is primary to competence.

Warm groups > competent groups from and adaptive perspective. More valuable to be part of a group than not.  Group will provide for you -> positive perceptions.

Overall group warmth predicts valence (positive/negative) and competence predicts the magnitude (how positive/negative). Warmth is the underlying primary factor. 

When asked about most important traits typically list warm traits (eg. honest, sincere, loyal) and more quickly and vividly remember warm vs competence words. 

-
Implicit biases

Unconscious environmental cues affect our behaviour. 

- subliminally flashing black faces increased hostile behaviour
- our initial biases change our behaviour in an interview (self-fulfilling prophecies)

Being aware of these biases is the first step towards combatting them.

-
Corell et al study 1

Participants played a video game that required them to make the decisions to shoot vs not shoot (black or white people). There was a higher pay off for accuracy, motivated to control prejudice. Want to tell if they are holding guns.

Strong real world implications; police officers must make the decision on a daily basis. Topical lately in the news. 

Do our implicit biases affect us even when we are motivated?

All white participants, performed a sophisitcated go-no-go task. 

IV: black vs white person in the image

IV: person had gun vs not (revolver or glock vs control [cell phone])

DV: reaction time, accuracy

Result: 

- armed: took more time to shoot white people with guns than black people with guns (despite the motivation)
- unarmed: quicker to press not shoot for white people than black

-
Study 3

Does personal prejudice predict the shooter bias?

Participants (mostly white) completed the same go-no-go task as well as scales of modern racism, prejudice, and personal and cultural stereotyping.

IV: white vs black person in the image

IV: gun vs control item

DV: accuracy, reaction time

Correlated shooter bias with self reported personality variables. Self reported prejudice is statistically uncorrelated with people's shooter bias. 

Support of cultural norms (cultural stereotypes) are correlated. What do other people think/what does your culture think.

Increased contact with the shooter group positively correlated with sooter bias. 

-
Study 4

Replication of study 1 in an adult sample of mixed races. 

IV: white vs black person in the image

IV: gun vs control item

DV: accuracy, reaction time

Found exact same result, regardless of race. Implicit biases are ingrained, even if we are part of that group.

Summary: 

Implicit biases and cues change behaviour even in more applied settings, when motivated to control them

These biases are present above and beyond personal prejudices.

Other races also demonstrate this bias and suggest that it is a cultural phenomenon. 

-
Kawakami et al

Brought to the lab with 2 "participants" already waiting (one black, one white). The black participant "forgets his cellphone" and leaves the room, as he leaves he bumps the white "participant" and once gone he responds with a racial slur.

IV: imagine this scenario vs experience it (experiencer vs forecaster)

IV: no slur vs moderate slur vs extreme slur

- no comment
- typical, I hate it when black people do that
- clumsy n-word

DV: negative emotions, likelihood of working with the white participant

Result:

- forecaster: no comment, avg negative emotion (around 5), people reported a lot of negative distress towards moderate and extreme recist comments. Said they wouldn't select the person when they were racist.
- experiencer: nonsignificant differences between the slur conditions. Didn't report any more negative distress/emotion than if they hadn't said a slur. Would still select the experimenter (above 50%) to work with them.

No black participants, though lots of other races.

Wanted to rule out vividness as an explanation, so another study was a video recording. Results showed that they said they would have negative feelings towards this racist person. Still react differently.

Believability: wanted to rule out that people thought it was contrived. Study 3 told them that it was a real interaction vs contrived. 

Both studies showed the exact same results. 

People mispredict their feelings even in the most extemely prejudice scenarios.

Behaving this way perpetuates modern racism.

In the study where contact with black people was correlated with more bias against black people, this might be explained by these people paying attention to these cues when they usually wouldn't be.

Social identities are multi-faceted. 

We draw self esteem from groups (social identity theory) therefore we don't want to feel negatively toward our own ingroups.

In situations that might confirm a stereotype there is increased pressure and stress to avoid spreading the stereotype, this is called stereotype threat. 

Racial gap in academic achievement. Gender differences in math and physics. 

Gender differences in computing. 

Racial differenced in athletic ability, eg. NBA is mostly black. 

Racial differences in math.

Black students performed worse on a 'diagnostic test of intellect' than whites (vs when just worded as a challenging problem solving task). Induced the stereotype threat.

Bringing attention the the stereotype impaired perforamnce.

Other stereotypes; women writing their gender before vs after an advanced placement calculus test do 33% worse.

White males being told they were compared to asians on a diagnostic math test perform worse.

Becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Threat reduces performance -> failure is internalized -> reduces future effort toward the task and abandonement of the goal

People become less invested and identified with a domain following stereotype threat.

Negative spiral.

Stereotype threat reduces women's ability to resist eating a tasty food, increases aggression, risk-taking and cognitive control

Reduced working memory capacity.

Increased stress, anxiety, and arousal. 

Stereotypes work as heuristics to reduce cognitive load. 

How can we reduce the impact of stereotype threat?

Self-affirmation brings to mind core goals and values that reduce focu on the threat and maintains self-esteem. Feel less threatened when exposed to stereotype threat. Identifiy other domains in your life that are successful. 

Self affirmations reduce stress and cortisol release. Increase goal commitment and overcoming barriers. Less defensiveness following threat. Increases academic performance of black students. Increases self control following depletion.

Spencer et al

Group of student that got a B or higher in calculus, and did well at math SATs. Men and women

Induced no stereotype threat. 

IV: difficult vs easy math test  

IV: women vs men

DV: test performance

Result: easy test - everyone did very well. On the harder test, women did considerably worse than men. 

-
Study 2

Is this actually due to ability or stereotype threat?

Hard math test

IV: women vs men

IV: test description (ie. stereotype threat)

- participants told that that the test typically showed gender differences
- or told the test typically had no differences

DV: test perforamcne

Result: framing test as stereotype threat predicted performance. No statistically significant difference in the non threatening condition.

Women made to believe that a math test previously showed gender differences were likely to feel additional pressure in the form of stereotype threat.

Martens et al study 1

Does self-affirmation work to eliminate stereotype threat?

Men and women completed either a set of "reasoning problems used for future research" or a "test of math and reasoning abilities" (stereotype threat vs not)

Then complete a self affirmation task

IV: stereotype threat vs not

IV: affirmation vs no affirmation

DV: mean number of correct answers

Result: affirmations reduce the impact of stereotype threat. 

-
Study 2

IV: threat vs no threat

IV: affirmation vs none

DV: performance on spatial rotating task

result: affirmation only seemed to boost women, not men. 

Boost in performance only affects people experiencing stereotype threat.
