# PSYCH 253

## Lecture 2 - Sep 9

Social psychology is the study of social thinking (how we perceive ourselves and others), social influence, and social relations.

### Information Processing Model

Goal-regulation theory. There are many models of human behaviour.

We are biased information processors.

### Theory of mind

Implied consequences of actions. You are able to infer that people around you also have minds and are sentient. Other beings have unobservable mental processes going on.

A _social brain_ is related to interpersonal interactions. Social animals demonstrate complex and large brain mass. 

Eg. chimpanzees can recognize intention.

Social behaviour is learned - we start as ego-centric individuals.

Children under the age of 3.5 fail perspective taking.

People with autism have a lack of social skills, perform poorly at perspective-taking tasks. (eg. with a picture of eyes, telling what they are expressing).

### Social Facilitation

Bike riders did better when in the presence of others. Triplett had people perform against others (simulated fish reeling)

Some individuals are faciliated by the presence of others. But some experienced inhibition of behaviour (nervous tension/anxiety)

Zajonc theorized that dominant responses are augmented by audiences.

Mere presence vs audience have different results.

Arousal and drive result in higher expression of dominant responses.

Yerkes-Dodson law: there is an optimum amount of arousal/drive.

Realistically everyone has their own arousal curve.

## Lecture 3 - sept 14

Where does self-concept/self-identity come from?

We use behaviours to extrapolate instances where we are good at different things and derive abstract representations - self-schemas. It becomes very ingrained, very core to us.

We often change our concept of self depending on our environment, who we interact with. 

We look to other people to evaluate ourselves. 

We use comparisons with other people when we are threatened with our identity/sense of self. We make downward comparisons to increase our mood.

We also make upwards social comparisons => negative mood. Sometimes though, if we have confidence in our own capabilities, looking upwards may not always end up in negative affective state. May be inspiring, if we feel like we could achieve this state.

Happiness moderates impact of social comparisons.

Had people to word unscrambles. Had people perform really fast or slow - makes an implicit social comparison. Test subjects also reported their own ability.

People with below average happiness were more affected by a faster peer. 

Another study: asked participants to create a puppet show with 2 puppets. In order to manipulate comparisons, they had a confederate perform the same tasks. The confederate always got one type of feedback. In the upwards comparison, subjects got got positive feedback, but they were still worse than the confederate. So positive feedback + upwards comparison. Measured changes in mood pre + post comparison. In the downwards comparison condition subjects got rated poorly, but confederate did even worse than them. 

Had happy + sad participants to start. __Look at slides for these result graphs__

In collectivistic cultures achievement is attained as a group, as opposed to individualistic western cultures.

Another study compared reward distributions of collectivists vs individualists. 

Independent variable: performance (high vs low) and anonymity (anonymous vs not)

DV: distribution of monetary rewards

Americans followed equity principle: i did more work so i deserve more.

Chinese followed equality principle, gave equal allocation regardless of work.

Difference disappeared when allocation was anonymous. Anonymity allowed people to lose identity (eg. lose collectivist identity)

Our self-knowledge isn't very objective. Impact bias and planning fallacy (in textbook). 

Impact bias - overrepresenting positive feelings from something, eg team winning or new iphone.

Planning fallacy - when you overrepresent the time we spend working on something. We think that we have laser focus into what our behaviour will be/our motivation. But we can't comprehend all of the extraneous behaviours that influence us. Their are situational influences that modify our behaviour.

Study: record how long we're going to be spending on 10 different activities. 24 different blanks - for each hour in the day, what they might be doing. 

DV: predect how you might feel if team won or lost football game (football fans).

Wins and losses are both mitigated (happier losing, less happy winning) because they see what else is part of their day. 

Another correlational study, observe fans feelings over losses. Very slight increased in baseline mood after loss (so many other things going on in their lives - pychological immune system). 

Same after winning, slight decrease in happiness actually. 

When no game, thanksgiving, high increase in happiness.

We experience feelings completely different to how we predict them. The way we predict them also affects how we experience them.

Another study, participants predicted their happiness and then gave an actual rating. When you add more details to your day, you realize that the impact of the football game is low. We have very poor introspective abilities. 

Another correlation study - what is people's dispositional level of happiness? Predict happiness after getting final grades, and then measure them. Had no correlation to how they actually felt. You think you're gonna feel a certain way - but it actually has no bearing on what you actually feel. 

## Lecture 4 - Sep 16

Poor access to our mental processes. Explicit vs implicit attitudes. Cognitive conscious thoughts, and automatic thoughts. No correlation between these two (explicit thought vs implicit association). 

People try to explain implicit thoughts but often get them very wrong. Implicit attitudes test. 

Social desirability bias - don't want to have these implicit associations. Spreading activation - adjacent neurons. Some of the concepts will be more closely associated than others. 

Self esteem is your attitude towards or evaluation of the self. Our self esteem is a socio-meter. Indicator of how well we are doing in our social environment. People are motivated to maintain high self esteem. 

Low self-esteem predicts aggression, anti-social behaviour, and deliquency. 

In the late 90s and early 2000s, psychologists wanted improve people's self esteem, eg. participation trophies. 

But narcissists (inflated self esteem) are agressive and anti social too. More likely to retaliate when threatened. Can become extremist. 

Study measured explicit vs implicit self esteem. People with explicit high self esteem actually had lower implicit self esteem. Donut people. Unstable sense of self. 

Explicit self esteem really doesn't mean much. 

Self-control is social. We inhibit primitive pre-potent inpulses for delayed rewards (willpower). Poor self-control predicts anti-social behaviour. 

Ego-depletion: exerting self-control reduces subsequent efforts. 

Taste perception: please don't eat 3 hours before. 

IV resist temptation to eat cookies (ate radishes) vs taste-test the cookies vs no food control group

Asked group 1 to not eat cookies (self control), group 2 let them eat cookies, group 3 no food.

DV: presistence at an impossible tracing task. Having eaten radishes and depleted self control, group 1 gave up on the task much before the other groups. 

Depleting self control resources. Argument that it is a self-fulfilling prophecy: beliefs and attitudes shape our behaviour. 

We balance our want-to and have-to selves. 

Another study: read different descriptions of willpower. group 1: willpower is limited and needs rest and recovery. group 2: exerting willpower can be energizing for other activities. 

Half of participants exerted self-control and half did a control task. Cross study, 4 groups. Willpower - cross out letter Es in a passage. Other study had specific Es to cross out. 
DV: performance at self-control task (stroop task).

Results showed that we don't really understand self control. People can be trained into it not depleting. (Like above study)

We fail at predicting the future self. Hyperbolic discounting. 100 now vs 120 in a week or 120 in a month vs 140 in 5 weeks. We have a bias for the present moment. People who get into debt. 

Self-serving bias: success = self vs failure = situation. This maintains our self-esteem. Eg. group projects: everyone thinks that they did more work. 

Theory of mind: able to perceive what other people are thinking. We present desirable images of ourselves. We feel less need to do impression management around friends. This is because the people around you know you already.

## Lecture 5 - Sep 19

Context matters - new and old cues in your environment will shape your actions. Social beliefs and judgements dictate how you perceive the situation and how you act in it. Our judgements and preconceptions are cued by out context. Can have implicit cues that prime different behaviours (don't even notice). 

We analyze our environment and make patterns/predictions. We later rely on these patterns, sometimes unconsciously. 

Priming - cognitive concepts can be activated through primes, influencing our behaviour. The brain is a collection of neural networks, activating one node can lead to "spreading actiation". 

Can we subconsciously prime and change behvaiours? 

IV: primed with concept of rude vs polite vs neutral. Completed a scrambled sentence task. 

DV: polite vs rude behaviour. Experimenter was stuck "explaining" the SST to confederate (timed how long it took participant to interrupt). (pulled into a room, experimenter was helping explain to confederate). Timed how long it would take them to interrupt. 

People who were primed with politeness interrupted significantly less, then neutral, then rude. 

Are social judgements related to behaviour; can they too be primed?

IV: primed with concept of elderly vs neutral (scrambled sentence task)

DV: gave debrief on study, then left. Timed how long took them to walk to elevator to leave. 

They thought people primed with elderly thoughts would be slower, and they were. Replicated this again in another study. This suggests that even without explicitly targeting a behaviour, the generalized stereotype was enough to cause the behaviour. 

We should be cognisant of all of the things that influence our behaviour. 

-
Can hostile behaviour be primed with an African-American stereotype. 

Subliminal vs supraliminal `!=` unconscious vs conscious. 

Conscious vs unconscious: can bring to the front of mind/working memory, vs not able to.

Subliminal: outside of conscious perceptual field. 

Faces shown subliminally during long, boring estimation task. Higher ecological validity. We might not ever be aware of these things. 

People who were primed with black faces were more hostile than those primed with caucasian faces. We can never be 100% aware of all of our biases. 

-

Patient with blindsight (had stroke in right side of brain, couldn't perceive the left side of the world). 

Showed patient pictures of houses and asked her to select her preference. One of the houses was on fire on the left side. 9/11 times she chose the non burning house. When the house was burning on the right side, she correctly chose the house. 

-
Schemas don't only affect current behaviour, but memories as well. Schemas drive our automatic associative behaviour. 

Misinformation effect: incorporating schema-congruent information resulting in false memories. This works because the misinformation _feels right_. Confidence doesn't always predict reality. 

-
Belief perserverance: people believe firmly in their judgements and are hard to persuade. 

People use strength over weight when evaluating confidence. Strength of their memories over weight. 

Strength: positive/warmth of a reference letter (eg. size of an effect)

Weight: credibility of the source (eg. sample size)

Flip a coin 5 times and it's all heads: strength is high, weight is low. 

IV: presented with 12 coin=spinning scenarios. Bias of 60% but not sure where it's biased to.

DV: asked people which way they thought it was skewed. 

People over-guessed how likely it was. s

Testimonials work well because the strength is high. 

-
Hyperbolic discounting: as things get further in time, they get more similar. We value the present moment much more. 

## Lecture 6 - Sep 21

Confirmation bias: we focus on evidence that supports, rather than falsifies our intuitions. We don't look for stuff that is against our views. Look for info that confirms our beleifs, no matter how weak it is.

-
IV: difficulty of passage stimulus (disfluency). Presented in hard to read font.

DV: stance on capital punishment (controlling for political ideology). 

-
The reasons we utilize conf bias is because we make use of heuristics. They are mental shortcuts, save our cognitive capacity. Lets us save executive function for more important things.

We store schemas instead of memories. Our brains are very efficient. 

Availability heuristic: recent/available information biases our judgements. 

Representativeness heuristic: our mental schemas or representations colour our intuitive judgements. 

These biases typically work for us, but in some situations they fail us. 

-
Illusory correlation: two distinct events become linked; increased attention to rare events.

Illusory control: gambling; individuals believe they have influence on the outcome. 

More likely to react with negative reinforcement.

-
Tested the idea of "paired distinctiveness".

We are likely to associate events together.

IV: read about group a or group b individuals. 

39 statements more positive (27) than negative (12) statements (9:4)
26 in group a, 13 in group b (2:1)

DV: accuracy in recalling behaviours, estimates of typical traits of group members.

Individuals over-estimated the likelihood that group b had negative traits, inaccurately recalled more negative behaviours. 

-
counter factual thinking

Hypothetical scenarios with alternative outcomes that "almost" happened.

Can be near misses (downward) or (upward) in nature.

Purposes for this type of thinking?

- suggested that we use it for affective reasons
- also for preparation for future events (avoid some negative result, therefore motivational)

-
Attribution theory

We perceived behaviour in terms of "causes" (recall theory of mind)

Fundamental attribution error: we lack information, more likely to attribute behaviour to internal (vs external)

Dispositional attribution vs situational attribution. Have more insight to the reasons behind your actions. We have more leeway for our own actions. 

-
Ross et al. study 1

Participants brought into a lab for a quiz game experiment, no confederates.

IV: experimental vs control condition

- experimental: questioner developed hard questions for contestants (q will know answer, reflective of intelligence)
- control: questioner asked pre-selected questions for contestant (q may not know answer)

DV: self ratings of knowledge, and partner's knowledge.

E: contestants rated questioner as smarter, own intelligence rated as about average
C: contestants rated questioner as less smart, themselves as more smart

-
Study 2

Replication of study 1 except participants are observers, everyone else is a confederate.

Watched questioner come up with 10 questions, and contestant had to answer.

DV: ratings of knowledge of questioner and contestants.

- q mean knowledge: 82
- c mean knowledge: 40

Summary: we are more prone to attribute to disposition rather than situation. 

Study 2, even stronger effect. Demonstrates actor-observer bias. Lack of insight into perspective of actor and under-valuing influence of social environment. 

-
Self fulfilling prophecy: 

Partipants given role of an interview

IV: white vs black confederate

DV: video taped and measured social cues towards to confederate

Differential treatment of black and white confederates. Both confederates trained to act/answer in same ways.

Interviewers sat further away from black confederates. 

-
Will interviewer behaviour influence performance?

Flipped, confederates were interviewers.

IV: more vs less positive social cues (eg. longer interview, closer distance, verbal errors)

DV: interview performance rated by observers

Results as expected. 

## Lecture 7 - Sep 23

Social situation derives your identity. 

Slacktivism. 

Sometimes we have specific attitudes towards a behaviour that we don't follow through on. We don't necessarily follow through on our intentions. 

Attitudes have an evaluative component. We think about mental objects, and evaluate them in some way. They are ingrained in our memories. Part of the attitudes are implicit.

We also have affective, behavioural, and cognitive consequences. Dual attitudes - implicit vs explicit. Work together to predict our behaviour. 

When your attitudes are primed in your mind/strongly represented, then you are more likely to act in accordance with your attitudes. 

-
Study, participants completed go/no go task. Presented with specific stimuli, press a button in response, or not press button. Respond to odd numbers, withhold when given letters.

IV: experimental group develop a specific plan to respond to a number vs control group spent time looking over stimuli. 

Developing specific attitudes and intentions leads to better attitude-behaviour consistency. 

Potent attitudes -> behaviours.

Being inconsistent with our attitudes creates a type of tension. Drawing attention to self-awareness will improve attitude-behaviour congruency. (Cognitive dissonance)

-
Participants come into lab for a "teaching" experiment. 

Pre-screened individuals for punishment attitudes. Private: I believe that the use of physical punishment could never be considered right.

Public: most people believe that the use of physical punishment could never be considered right.

When attitudes become more salient will make you more likely to be consistent with attitudes.

IV: control vs eye level mirror vs audience (public norms) vs audience (no public norms)

PArticpants had to teach confederate a list of words, shock them every time they made a mistake.

Eye level mirror to induce self awareness, or audience watching, or audience but they weren't evaluating the individual. Hyp: audience evaluating has more of an effect on self awareness than audience not evaluating. 

case 1: only selected people with lower condoning of punishment. These people shocked less than control. Attitudes became stronger predictor. When alone, less consistent with attitudes.

(people who believed in punishment). When they were made self aware, more likely to punish.

Private attitudes -> behaviour when self-aware using a mirror

-
Theory of planned behaviour.

Behaviour having recursive effect, bi-directional relationship. 

Some actors, in order to get into the mindset, they live their lives that way to think and believe in the same way as that character. Doing a certain behaviour can affect our thoughts and attitudes. 

-
Stanford prison experiment. Everyone's behaviour became very extreme, stopped experiment early. 

## Lecture 8 - Sep 26

20 m/c from textbook readings

theme of the course - based on understanding of social psych, not concerned with names/dates. 

-
Harmon Jones study

Do behaviours increase commitment and change attitudes?

IV: made a difficult (more similar choices) vs easy decision (choose easy thing vs hard thing)

DV: measured attitudes towards decision. 

After you make a decisional commitment to one choice, you start to dislike the other one more, even if liked it more before decision. 

Other examples: foot in the door, saying becomes believing, lowball technique. 

What are the mechanisms behind this?

Might help us cope with the fact that we are forced to do something. 

Cognitive dissonance, Self-presentation, self perception.

Want to present a consistent self to the world. Don't want to perform a behaviour and say you are doing something else. 

We like to resolve our cognitive tension and align our behaviours and thoughts. 

Self-perception: when our attitudes aren't formed yet. We perform behaviours without knowing why, and observe it, and then come up with reasons as to why. 

-
Self-presentation

We don't want to look like liars. Want to show the world that we are consistent in terms of thoughts and behaviours. If i lose my favourite glasses - I didn't like those glasses anyways. 

Tice study - does our public self-image affect how much our attitudes change following behaviour?

Partipants were told to portray a trait during an assessment interview (even if they didn't have it).

IV: public vs privately demonstrated (one-way mirror)

- emotional stabillity
- emotional responsiveness

Did behaving this way (private vs public) influence people's attitudes? 

Cross study: either stability/responsiveness, either private/public. So 4 cases. 

Control was athleticism, so extra 2 cases. 

Hypothesis: public presentation changes.

DV: self-ratings of portrayed trait.

Talked on intercom to grad student (public) or recording answers (private). 

After completing interview questions - rate their own traits that they were asked to exhibit.

Those asked to be stable rated themselves as more stable, and vice versa. 

Evidence for self-presentation theory. Present/change attitudes when in a public setting.

In control, self ratings (scale 0-25) were more average (12-13)

All the particpants knew they were being told to act this way, but still internalized it as their disposition. 

Tice - study 2:

replicated study 1 and extended it to see if self-presented behaviour -> attitude -> behaviour.

IV: introverted vs extroverted

IV: public vs private

DV: measured self-ratings

DV: how far they sat away from confederate, how many conversations they initiated with confederate

results:

- self rating in extraversion was lower in those told to be introverted, sat further away from research confederate

We are not changing attitude just for world to see, it also affects our behaviour. Makes our behaviour congruent with actions. 

Self presentation plays a key role in shifting our attitudes following behaviour. 

We want to create a consistent image of ourselves. 

-
Self justification; cognitive dissonance

We don't want to look/feel like liars. Want our behaviour to match our attitudes.

Conflicting, inconsistent cognitions create tensions. Reduce dissonance by adjusting our thinking and our attitudes (instead of behaviour). 

Changing the behaviour isn't possible because you did it already, can only change cognition. 

Explaining away our behaviour to make our cognitions make sense. Can't undo the behaviour. 

-
Study: hour long boring peg-turning task. 

Then asked to tell another "participant" that it was fun. How do we resolve this conflict? 

IV: paid either `$1` or `$20` to cover-up experiment.

DV: attitidues towards experiment. 

When you were in low resistance condition (20 bucks), vs high disonance condition (1 dollar). Were told to lie but with insufficient justification. Had to resolve the dissonance by thinking that they liked the experiment more. 

When you don't have sufficient justification and can't explain-away behaviour, then you change your cognition, internalizing it to match the behaviour. 

-
Self-perception theory (Bem)

We look to behaviour to explain our attidues. 

In this theory, participants observed how much they got paid and this is what dictated their attitudes.

Explains why intrinsic motivation can turn into extrinsic motivation. Over-justification effect: if you receive too much of an incentive for something, do the behaviour because of it, even if you enjoy it. Old man paying kids to play in his yard. 

-
Fazio

IV: created expectancy vs no expectancy for rewards

tested kids and their motivations to play with magic markers.

DV: time spent playing

Took a picture of kids playing with markers. Brought htem back into lab a few weeks later, gave them same magic markers, told them if they played they would receive reward. Also randomly allocated to priming previous attitudes or not. (pictures of playing with no extrinsic motivation) Would this attenuate over-justification effect?

When there was a low salience of initial attitudes (no pictures) they were demotivated. 

Support idea that people develop attitudes based on observing themselves. 

-
Zanna + Cooper

Demonstarted that that 1 vs 20 dollar case was a different mechanisms. 

Both theories make same prediction, different mechanisms. Getting paid \$20 makes you enjoy the activity less. 

-
Misattribution

Cooper and Zanna gave participants a pill (really a placebo) that they said would make them feel aroused. This would create a misattribution, and explain away why they might experience the tension/arousal.

IV: high or low choice situation (not induce cognitive dissonance)

IV: given a pill that was labeled arousal vs relaxation (or no pill as control)

When you could explain away arousal to the pill, the effect of dissonance disappeared. Even greater dissonance if given relaxtion pill. 

This is evidence against self-perception theory and supports the original idea of cognitive dissonance as an explanation for why beahviour -> attitudes. 

Doesn't mean self-perception is totally wrong. When we don't have well-formed attidues (where we cant have dissonance) we rely on behavioural cues to infer attitudes. 

## Lecture 9 - Sep 30

Internal (self-perception, self presentation, dissonance) vs external (convincing argument, new knowledge, inception: the idea seems to be internally driven, persistence, foot in the door, credibility of person) sources of attitude change 

- no hard and fast rules for persuasion, individual differences make us more susceptible to certain arguments. 

Central vs peripheral rules.

- central: facts, actual reasons
- peripheral: other aspects of our attitudes. implicit automatic associations

Central route processing leads to stronger attitude changes, involves processing of core ideas. Requires motivated audience, difficult and effortful. 

Peripheral route processing relies on cues that are not directly tied to the message content. Affective feelings towards the message/speaker. Complexity of the argument, perceived expertise of the speaker. 

Can never describe a smell to somebody, so cologne/perfume adds use peripheral routes. There's no content, can't accurately portray that the smell is better. Can't make the info available.  

Not as long lasting attitude change. 

-
Chaiken

How and when do we process peripheral or central cues?

IV: high vs low processing of the message (ie. relevance) (consequences)

IV: peripheral cue: likeable vs not likeable message souce (insulted vs praised undergraduates in an interview transcript)

IV: central cue (message contained 6 vs 2 arguments)

Peripheral cue: chose likeable vs unlikeable speaker's point. Highly influenced about the cue. Not having to think deeply about the subject makes you not think deeply about the content. 

Central cue: more influenced by central cues. 

When issue is relevant, we are persuaded by central cues (strength of argument)

When it's not an important issue, peripheral cues (likeability) more strongly influences attitudes. 

-
Patzer

Does attractiveness increase credibility?

Participants rated their attitudes towards a fictional pain relief medication that was endorsed by a person (picture) that varied in attractiveness. 84 pictures accross 120 participants, rated on attractiveness.

Studied trustworthiness, expertise, liking. Most attractive people had highest scores in all. Being shown no photo is better than being shown a bad photo of some person (ugly). 

We judge these things based on attrativeness, no effects or interactions with gender.

Why is this?
Stereotype beauty = good. Evolutionary advantage, symmetry = more healthy. 

Advertisers utilize this with celebrity endorsements. The hot people on adds seem more trustworthy, expert. 

-
Reason vs emotion

Edwards

Do persuasive appeals need to match their attitude scores?

Eg. getting very sore after first time exercising. 

Manipulated attitudes towards Chinese characters. Looked at tpeople's changes in attitudes towards characters pre and post manipulation.

IV: source of attitude,

- subliminally flashed a face, then viewed a character, then read about it, then viewed it
- viewed character, read about it, subliminally flashed a face, then viewed a character, 

Also I: given either an emotioal appeal, or cognitive appeal

DV: change in liking of character, confidence in judgement

Negatively affected the thoughts. 

Type of emotional change, or cognitive attitude change message. 

2 happy: 2 angry. Each one has affect based and cognition based. 

When you base your attidue on cognition, have to change it using cognition.

Have to match how they formed the attitude with how the attitude will be changed. 

Attitude changes as a result of both, but stronger effect when you match the method.

summary: subliminal and suprialiminal persuasion both seem to change attitudes. Matching the attitude source is key in maximizing persuasion.

-
Uncertainty and Persuasion

When they have more strength, more likely to be affected by their persuasion. 

Incongruence (conflicting ideas) generates stronger attitudes because it creates more central processing. Put more attention into what's going on. Behavioural inhibition system (BIS) notices incongruencies and directs attention there - increases central processing in those fields. 

Propaganda vs education: propaganda is 1 sided, no uncertainty. 

Expert sources that exhibit certainty in their opinions and attitudes do not violate our expectations (no further elaboration)

Accordingly, non-expert sources should demonstrate uncertainty. Not a lot of experience in the topic. 

-
Karmarkar + Tormala

Does conflicting source and certainty chars increase persuasion?


IV: source expertise: food critic vs network admin

IV: level of certainty, definitive rating vs wishy washy rating

DV: ratings of attitudes on restaurants

Non expert source + high certainty changed attitudes the most. 

Experts + low certainty changed attitudes more than high certainty. 

We imagine expert to always give us strong definitive results, When they give us uncertain results, makes us think about the message more, makes us accept it more. Primed central route processing, more invested in the review, paid more attention to it. Incongruency increased central processing.

Non-expert source, when opposite happens, very sure of attitude, really catches our attention as well. 

Expert sources that are uncertain are most persuasive.

Also non-expert certain.

Lots of individual differences in persuasion. 

## Lecture 10 - Oct 3

Persuasion depends on central vs peripheral routes.

Trump and wall is persuasion based on peripheral routes, based on speaker.

Credibility can be based on attractiveness. 

Matching attitudes - must be changed through the same route. 

Message channel: once the source and message are chosen, how do we decide how to convey it?

Effect of the audience: msg must be well-received and accepted by the recipient. 

-
Message channel: how the message is communicated

Central vs peripheral. 

Face to face vs written. 

-
det Wit et al

In person, can get more information. Messages are provided with more vivid detail and can be more persuasive. Greater attitude changes.

IV: message of increased HBV risk (hep b)

- personal account: narrative, first-person story
- statistical evidence: matched passage (in length)
- mere assertion: single statement suggesting male-male sexual relations increases risk
- control: no statements

DV: mean scores regarding risk perception

Some evidence for the idea that narrative personal accounts can have greater attitudinal changes. 

Individuals in the narrative condition demonstrated highest risk perceptions and intentions to get vaccinated. 

Statistically significant risk mediation.

-
Bickart and Schindler

How does online (media vs personal influence) information affect consumer behaviour?

IV: students researched one of 5 categories (biking, exercise equipment, supplements, photography, stereo equipment)

IV: corproate websites vs forums

DV: measured intentions to purchase items, knowledge on topics, thoughts and interest in those topics

People showed significantly more interest in product when reading on forums. 

Summary: personalized information vs mass media appeals are more effective. Not controlled for content. 

Reduced perceptions of bias. Central route (written with more thought, demonstrate individualization). Possible empathy and vividness of message. 

-
Message framing eample

Messages can be written to emphasize losses or gains.  People are attentive to negatively or positively framed messages: negative information is undesirable. 

-
Smith and Petty

How do people respond to positively or negatively framed message.

IV: negative or positive framed message

- negative: no recycling will elad to landfill use (already x% full)
- positive: recycling will reduce landfill use (x% full)

IV: weak or storng arguments

- weak: 25%
- strong: 75%

DV: agreement with message, thoughts listed related to recycling

Negative framing: people were more attentive to the strength of the argument. 

Negatively framed info is more attended to, people are less convinced by weaker arguments. More likely to think deeply about negative messages. 

Is this due to expectation?

-
Study 2, smith and petty

If we expect positive messages, do we more carefully read negative frames? 

IV: negative or positive

- negative: not taking vitamin k increases risk of heart disease by x%
- positive: taking k reduces heart disease risk by x% 

IV: weak or strong:

- 0.1% vs 10%

DV: effectiveness of message

Unexpected information draws your attention more (not just negative info). 

Summary: particpants expecting information (positive or negative) were unaffected by argument strength. However receiving a message that violates expectation is more salient. 

-
Two step process of media

We are all influenced by the media, directly and indirectly. 

People in our social netowrk (on and offline) influence our attitudes. 

Audience characteristics. Not all messages fall on the same set of ears. 

Marketing researches tailor messages to our characteristics. Some individuals are more easiliy persuaded than others

-
Hirsch et al

Do ads work better when tailored to personality?

IV: received a message based on big-5 personality trait

- 5 ads of different phones with captions aimed to each of B5
- eg extraversion: with the phone A you'll always be where the excitement is
- eg neuroticism: stay safe and secure with the phone b

Significant positive correlation with how the advertising worked and correlation with b5 traits. 

Emphasizes that messages should target the audience and be tailored accordingly. 

Resisting persuasion

Counter arguments: key to resisting attitude change, solidifies our initial attitudes. Coutner arguments only work to increase attitudes if we believe our arguments were wrong. gotta believe em

## Lecture 11 - Oct 5

What is conformity?

"Yielding to group pressures"

Eg. everyone goes to university, marriage, children. Why do we follow things because they are "convention"?

-
Sherif

How do we develop social norms?

Ambiguous stimulus used to develop artificial norm. Autokinetic effect (stationary light in dark room appears to move)

IV: confederate vs alone

IV: norm distance induced (ranging from 3-8 inches - 7 conditions)

DV: self-reported perceived distance over 50 trials, verbal estimate of average, reported influence of confederate

Reported that the norm was around 8 inches. Also aware that the other individual seemed to influence some of his decisions. 

Participants changed their estimates to match the experimentally induced norm. Carried over to 'alone' trials. 

Not all particpants were aware of external influence. 

-
Transmission of norms

Culture and traditions, people follow a set of rules/behaviours that we adopt from our social environment (eg. greetings, eye contact)

Why is this the case? What is the adaptive function of cultural norms?

harmony, acceptance, 

-
Whiten

Trained chimps to acquire food using a tool

IV: poke method vs lift method vs control

DV: adoption of behaviour among the group

Individuals taught a method were more likely to use it. 

Demonstrated methods to other chimps; evidence for social learning. 

-
Asch

How does group pressure influence our judgement?

IV: in a group (2-15 confederates) vs alone

DV: correct estimates in a judgement task. Estimate which one of 3 lines was most matched to standard line

When confederates were all selecting the wrong line, person did so more. 

Summary: we are strongly influenced by the ones around us, we comply and conform despite our better judgement to fit in.

Outward compliance vs private acceptance (internalization).

Don't necessarily believe the choice you are making. 

-
Goldstein et al

How does group pressure (in the form of social norms) influence towel re-use behaviour?

Observed client towel usage in 60 days

IV: emphasized how reusing towels was beneficial and norm based (standard environmental vs norm based)

DV: how much towels were reused

More reuse when norm based arguments. 

study 2

How does specific group pressure affect this normative influence?

IV: change the workding of each message to emphasize different social identities. 

Specific targeted messages induced behaviour more. 

Normative pressures are more effective than appeals to values in changing behaviour. Specific normative pressures most effective. 

-
Milgram

Shock people when told to by someone with "authority"

How willingly obedient are people? What promotes compliance?

Told study was about memory and punishment.

Participant given a sample shock. 

Learner in seperate room for participant. Polled a panel of experts when tehy thought people would stop, they all thought 135 volts (strong shock).

Always underestimate power of situation. 

Obtained behaviour much higher than estimate. 

Milgram manipulated immediacy of victim (proximity)

IV: other room and not heard and seen (until 300 volts) vs learner's protests could be heard (but not seen) vs same room as learner vs after 150 volts, participant had to force their hand onto the shock plate

DV: compliance (protest against the experimenter)

More protest when people are closer together. 

Removing experimenter from room dropped compliance to 30%

## Lecture 12 - Oct 7

We are sensitive to our social environment, conform to societal rules and regulations. 

Conformity: upholding social norms, maintaining collective behaviour. Degrees of conformity, not all behaviour compliance is equally weighted. 

Other societies exist where their norms are different

Naturalistic fallacy: we assume if people do things that are deviant from the norm, that is strange and bad. Just because it's the norm doesn't mean things "should" be that way. 

Proximal explanation: the direct effects of a behaviour, provides are superficial analysis of the purpose (the how)

There is general group pressure to fit in (normative influence)

We lack information and utilize others to help us make sense of the situation (situational influence)

These are reasons why you conform. 

Those able to socially conform demonstarte greater neutral self-control capacity. 

Group-related decison making is also related to greater frontal lobe activity. 

-
Debono et al (study 1)

Does self-control capacity affect conformity to social norms, specifically injunctive norms?

Injunctive norms - societal pressure (generalized), not everyone necesarily adheres too. Eg. shouldn't be on facebook during classs. Pressure to maintain how things should be. Generalized social pressures. 

Used Baumeister's two task paradigm. Depletion model of self control. 

IV: deplted vs non-depleted:

- typing paragraph task had to inhibit an impulsive response (dep: could not press e or space key, non dep: type everthing)

IV: anon vs identified. 

Adding anonymity makes someone less likely to conform. Don't suffer repercussions of social backlash. 

DV: number of difficult GRE analytical puzzles solved, cheating (binary), amount of time spent completing the tasks (after it was supposed to be done - cheating). Impossible tasks - reporting completed is cheating.

Anonymous and depleted individuals cheated most. 

-
Study 2

Norms that everyone does (descriptive norms) eg driving on right side of road, facing forward in lecture hall. 

IV: same typing task: depletion vs non depletion

DV: # times participant said 'thank you', also a binary variable of how the experimenter thoughtt ehy were nice. Experimenters blind to study.

More polite behaviour in people who weren't depleted.

Self control ability predicts conformity to social norms. Emphasizes the social nature of social control. 

Study 1: exerting self control resulted in more cheating

Study 2: exerting self control predicted less polite behaviour

-
Conformity; distal explanations

Public goods game: an experimental task where individuals can either co-operate for larger group rewards or defect for larger individual rewards. 

Everyone puts in 10 bucks, there is a multiplier, everyone gets slightly more.

If one person doesn't put any money in, they still get more given back to him. Eg. everyone 15 vs everyone 11.25 except one guy with 21.25

-
Adreoni and Petrie

How does idenficication influence conformity in a PGG?

IV: level of identification

- baseline: no info
- photo of participant
- information regarding contribution
- photo and information

When you're given the most identifiable information, most social compliance. 

Being identifiable increases conformity and contributions ot social good. Punishment towards defectors (lose social value)

Modelling behaviour by other individuals. 

-
Susceptibility to conformity

There are situational influences that increase conformity. 

The more people around you, the more likely you are to conform (group size) 

Informational influence - unaware of what's normal in the situation (lack of knowledge)

Personality characteristics (Agreeableness)

Social norms and culture

-
Darley

Does fear influence susceptibility to conformity?

IV: fear vs no fear. Told they would receive an electric shock after the trial to test their inner ear (induces fear)

IV: group similarity (made to believe that 3 other subjects (confederates) were also in the same condition, or they were in opposite condition)

2x2 experiment conditions

DV: conformity and agreement. How many metronome beats there are.

Fear and group similarity had highest conformity. 

Just fear also induced conformity. (Fear and no group)

Fear anticipation induces conformity.

-
Non-conformity

Why do we strive to be unique?

- Ego (social identity)
- Can represent desirable traits to the opposite sex
- informative of personality, attitudes, etc

-
Griskevicius stuy 1

How does self presentation affect our motivation to conform?

IV: different priming conditions

- self protection (fear) scenario prime
- romantic scenario/attracting a mate prime
- no passage control
- neutral passage control

DV: rating of abstract painting (conformity with confederates)

Fear prime - all more likely than control to conform. 

Attractive mate priming - men didn't conform. represenation of how dominant they are, independent. Men didn't conform in the negative condition, individuals rating the abstract painting well (group pressure was to rate it poorly). Representing a positive mindset in the men. Men less likely to be susceptible to group pressures of negativity. 

-
Study 2

When is an ideal situation for nonconformity?

IV: roantic mating prime vs control

DV: conformity

Objectivity to which answer was correct. 

Conformed less, wanted to be more correct. Seem more attractive to other mates.

Men - doinance

women - agreableness

## Lecture 13 - Oct 14

Moral Licensing, justifying our conformity.

We are motivated to maintain a high-self esteem (sociometer theory), it is an indicator of social value. When we perform immoral behaviours, we don't internalize them, we try to justify them. 

Do people ever consider themselves to be immoral?

Before reprehensible conduct, moral justification and palliative comparison (eg. stealing < killing), euphemistic labeling.

Leads to detrimental effects. Minimizing, ignoring, or misconstruing the consequences.

If there is a victim, dehumanization, attribution of blame. 

Also displacement of responsibility, diffusion of responsibility (eg. millgram exepriment, blame on experimenters)

-
Vincent et al

Do happy people engage in more moral disengagement?

IV: positive or neutral mood

- recall a life experience that was positive or neutral

DV: moral disengagement scale. (sometimes people deserve crimes against them, etc)

Result: people with more positive affect, agreed with stealing/lying in certain situations. More moral flexibility.

-
Study 2

Does this moral disengagement lead to immoral behaviour?

IV: 

- positive (vs. neutral) mood; induced using a cartoon clip vs screensaver
- self-awareness (high vs low); using a mirror

DV:
 
- moral disengagement
- stealing behaviour; participants completed a difficult arithmetic task and paid themselves based on performance. Each correct problem, got 50 cents for. Compared how many solved vs how much money they took.

People with high self awareness were less likely to steal money.

People with low self awareness were more likely to steal. Even stronger for poisitive affect and low self awareness more likely to steal. 

Positive affect: more likely to endorse negative behaviours, and perform them.

Behaviour is predicted by their attitudes. 

-
Social facilitation

Social presence facilitates behaviours.

-
Sympathetic-adrenal-medullary system

Quick acting system, acts out of PNS. Activates adrenal glands, epinephrine.

After the stressor is active for a longer period of time, then hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. 

-
Taylor et al

Do supportive vs unsupportive audiences result in stress?

IV: participants performed the trier social stress test (TSST) in varying audience conditions

- no audience
- supportive
- unsupportive

Measures salivary cortisol, heart rate. baseline, during task, recovery (within-subjects)

DV: physiological stress; heart rate, systolic blood pressure, salivary cortisol

Result: More stress during task. Positive condition had highest increase in salivary cortisol (even more than negative, though negative was higher than control).

-
Social loafing

Opposite of social facilitation. When engaged in group and working towards a goal, might slack a little. Reduce effort based on diffusion of responsibility. Less likely to internalize tasks on self and expect to complete them on own.

Expectations on group as a whole, rather than on self. Benefit from the effort of others. 

-
Fishbach et al

How do we increase goal participation?

Partipants assisted in a focus group. Came up with 10 slogans for a cell phone.

IV: identification with the group

- high: focus group of same Korean university
- low: other Korean universities 

IV: framing of the task progress

- accumulated: 50% done
- remaining: 50% remaining

DV: social loafing: number of ideas

Socially distant others: when 50% done come up with more.

Socially close: when 50% remaining come up with more. 

-
Fishbach study 2

What is the mechanism in these effects?

Told to come up with 50 promotional ideas for a cereal bar

IV: identification with group. Same university vs other universities

IV: framing of task progress. 24 done or 26 to go.

DV: ideas generated, perceived goal value and progress

Goal valuation predicted by group identification and framing.

Random others, contribute more when accumulated.

Socially close: contribute more when remaining.

If the goal is meaningful, will not socailly loaf.

Socially close others generally more ideas in both conditions, less social loafing. 

If you don't care about the goal will socially loaf (for the people who are not within a social group).

-
Fishbach study 3

Does these effects apply to real world settings?

PArticipants asked to contact friends to spread awareness of earthquake in Haiti. Teamed up with a group of 5 others to contact 50

IV: measured level of identification with group

IV: framing of progress: 24 done, 26 to go

DV: number of friends contacted. 

Result: high identification condition were more motivated when 26 left, rather than 24 done. Perceived goal progress dictates whether or not we socially loaf in high identification.

Low identification: low engagement in both conditions.

Participants low in identification benefit from thinking about accumulated progress. Knowing how much has been done boosts motivation as it increases valuation of the goal, but effects did not transfer to the real world (study 3).

## Lecture 14 - Oct 17

Pluralistic ignorance - bystander effect. Use people for social cues, their inability to act causes you to misinterpret the situation.

Deindividuation - loss of self awareness. When we lose self awareness, we no longer retain social norms/standards and out behaviour changes as a result. We perceive ourselves as individuals. Consequence of this is disinhibited behaviour. Less self control. More self-disclosure on the internet, a lot more anonymity. Unsupervised children were more likely to take more candy because couldn't be identified. More impulsive tendencies, lack of self control and executive functioning. When you remove yourself from a social environment, more likely to perform disinhibited behaviours that are antisocial in nature.

We can feel deindividuated when in large groups (riots) or music festivals (mosh pits). Youtube comments, mean tweets. People give into their impulses when no identifying info. In a lot of situations, become more aggressive, unless prosocial cues.

Deinviduation leads to disinhibition. Simple concrete behaviours in unison in a large group, stealing of conformity, loss of slef. Eg. marching in large group, consuming alcohol. Eg. welcome week cheering. 

-
Worchel and Andreoli

Do we individuate other people advantageously?

Teacher/learner.

Individuation information; name, personality, physical characteristics, habits, background, mottos

Deindividuation information; age, hometown, race, present residence, political party, religion

IV: affect (as learner)

- angry (negative feedback)
- not angry (positive feedback)

IV: feedback behaviour (as teacher)

- shock
- reward
- nothing, just record

IV: recall (this condition is less important)

- before feedback behaviour
- after feedback behaviour

DV: deindividuation of target (how much info they remembered)

Result: when participants had to shock targets, were more likely to deindividuate the learner. Don't want to create realistic depiction of person, don't want to think of them as a person. Congruent to Millgram's proximity to person being punished. Mirror neurons that fire when you observe pain. The more individuation you give to someone (also details) you also experience their pain. So when they knew they were going to shock people, less incidence on identifying information.

Result: when angry (form of disinhibited information), less likely to pay attention to individual in terms of specific information, more deindividuation.

People with positive feedback less likely to deindividuate when told they were going to give positive feedback. 

Rewarding behaviour increases recall of individuating information. Less likely to add vivid details to person. Converse when we anticipate aggression. 

Eg. sports events: us vs them, prepares us for competitive/aggressive behaviour. Situations of moral licensing (de-humanization). Also when focused on selfish gains, anarchy, us vs the man. 

-
Pluralistic ignorance

Why do people wait until the end of class to ask prof questions?

We use our social environment to gain information. 

Sometimes this backfired, leads to pluralistic ignorance. Eg. no one is asking questions because they all get the concept - but other students thinking same thing, no one wants to be judged. Assume everyone else understands concepts. 

-
Prentice and Miller

Pluralistic ignorance towards alcohol consumption. 

It's not the norm to drink in a reserved manner. 

Asked students their opinion on alcohol consumption habits at the university (princeton)

Said their habits and avg students habits

IV: self vs others' comfort/endorsement with alcohol habits

- self vs average (Study 1)
- self vs average vs friend (Study 2)

People's overall acceptance of drinking was below midpoint. People don't really endorse heavy drinking. Thought that average student endorsed it.

Over estimate everyone's endorsement of alcohol. Everyone is conforming to this norm regarding excessive drinking. 

Same effect in study 2. Avg > friend > self. Didn't endorse as much as avg student, but more likely to support culture of excessive drinking. 

This indicates pluralistic consumption. 

Study 3: do these perceptions eventually lead to attitude change? Will you eventually follow the norm?

Telephone interviews of students, 2 times during semester

IV: self vs others' comfort with alcohol habits

- self vs avg
- 2 time points (within subjects)

DV: rating of comfort

Women less likely to endorse norm + change attitudes and behaiours. Women more or less maintained refute of this norm.

Men changed their attitudes to better match what the social norm was. Believe in the culture and follow along with the norms. 

Males more likely to internalize perceived group norms and adjust attitudes towards these norms. Femalses resisted attitude change.

Author say that this may be biased, because men might be more predisposed to alcohol consumption norms than others. 

Individuals can mispredict feelings/attidues of their peers and follow along with norm that may be unreliable. 

-
Shelton and Richeson

7 studies that demonstrated that people mistakenly believe racial outgroups are disinterested in social interactions.

study 2:

Can pluralistic ignorance explain intergroup relations?

Participants imagined entering a dining hall and rated their interest in sitting with (white or black) students

IV: white vs black

IV: self vs others' rating (within-subjects)

DV: interest in interaction

White individuals rated black individuals a bit over average (outgroup). When asked to rate what that group thought of them, rated low interest (black people didn't want to sit with them much). 

Participant misperceived norms. Believed outgroup race less interested in contact. Perceived lack of interest is in reality due to fear of rejection.

Studies 5 and 6:

IV: fear of rejection vs lack of interest

IV: self vs others' ratings

DV: magnitude of ratings and interaction with outgroup

Result: people very afraid of being rejected by other social group, perceived lack of interest for them to integrate with self. Outgroup had the same thoughts as well. Disarity of information transfer. 

Own fear of rejection negatively predicted contact with outgroup. Interaction with ingroup, more likely to associate with ingroup if fear of rejection with outgroup. Higher intragroup contact less likely to interact with intergroup. 

Summary: we make assumptions which lead to pluralistic ingorance when misperceiving intergroup relations.

-
Groupthink

Large groups elicit strong conformity which can overcome rational thinking and assessment. People conform because they are misinformed and going along with crowd. 

The larger the group is, the larger the group consensus, the larger the drive to conform is. More likely to face large-scale ridicule if you don't conform. Leads to group polarization, risky shift. No one wants to argue position, becomes magnified, more extreme, people less likely to dissent. 

## Oct 19

Darwin and the Galapagos finches

Lot of stark similarities in physical/anatomical shape. Are they actually different species? Maybe there's a common factor that connects these animals together.

Beaks had developed in a way to become more adaptive to the environment they lived in. Phenotype that different was size and shape of beak. Adapted beak for the kind of food they ate. 

-
Altruism: exhibiting helping behaviour without any need or reciprocity. 

Is there really such a thing? Selfish genes survive - survival of the fittest. 

Supported by comparative psychology (cross-species study) as well as neurisocience. 

Inclusive fitness; organisms that successfully pass on their genes are the ones that perpetuated. 

Other factors, not just whether individual lives or dies.

Eg. meercats, their group will forage for different foods. Certain meercats sacrifice their own well being (act as sentries) and watch for predators. 

-
Hamilton's rule

We might help if ` rb - c > 0 ` where r = relatedness, b = benefit, c = cost

We are more altruitistic when we are related to people. Kin selection

In some situations, we help people who are unrelated to us. Eg. dog nursing tiger puppies. 

If there's no benefit to altruism, it will eventually get selected out. Traits that are useless would be phased out.

So there must be some sort of benefit to altruism. 

We feel indebted to people who are altruistic to us. Might push us to return the favour. (direct reciprocity)

Indirect reciprocity

-
Direct Reciprocity

Repeated interactions predict greater cooperation.

Public goods game - reductionist view of social environment. Psotive benefits if everyone contributes to public good. Make most money if you cooperate. If you are a defector, you make money from those who put it into the pool. Simplistic view of what cooperation can produce, and situations where you can increase/decrease cooperation. _Distal explanation_ of social behaviour. Conflict between high individual gains vs collective group gains

Prisoner's dilemma = simplified version. Both confess = long sentence, only one confess, 0 sentence for the one that confesses. If both silent, smallest sentence. Safest to always give up information, in this case. Staying quiet is the socially acceptable thing to do, but tattling is the most self serving, but less good for the group as a whole. 

-
Komorita study 1

Do people demonstrate altruism in a direct reciprocity scenario?

Group decision making game, no identifiable info, two options: co-operate or defect

IV:

a) 3 real people
b) 2 real people, 1 programmed with tit for tat (TFT) strategy for one of the two players
c) one real player, one programmed to cooperate on trial 1, then TFT for rest, the other defects on trial 1, then TFT for the rest

TFT, copy what you just did

DV: percent of cooperation

In (c), effective to cooperate with peers, cooperate more.

-
Komorita Study 2

What if the group size increases and randomness is introduced?

5 person group

IV: condition

a) 5 real people
b) 1 real person, 4 random
c) 1 real, 4 programmed, 1 did TFT, 1 did TFT with first program, 2 did random responding (overall 33% cooperation)
d) 1 real person, 4 programmed; same as above, except the last two (not random, did majority decision)

Result: Highest level of cooperation in condition d

There was a general baseline of cooperation.

-
Indirect Reciprocity

Helping other people might bring status, reputation. Displaying traits that you are a cooperative individual, other people may come to my aid. Indirect benefits through reputation or alternative related actor. 

-
Hardy and Van Vugt Study 1

High schoolers played PGG in groups of 3 (66 total)

\$1.75 to personal vs joint pool, only 2 rounds

Indirect benefits to being the biggest giver. 

IV: reputation vs no reputation (identifiable)

IV: round 1 vs round 2 (within subjects)

DV: percentage of cooperation

When you are identifiable, cooperate more in the 2nd round. 

More they donated, higher overall perceived status by other 2 participants. People who offered the most money had the lowest resources at the end of the game. There is a cost to altruism.

-
Study 3

Is reputation and altruism a dose-response relationship?

Watched a PGG game, 4 players were allocated seperate resources (\$10 or \$5)

IV: perceived altruism

a) got 10, gave 5
b) got 5, gave 5
c) got 10, gave 1
d) got 5, gave 1

Highest status for b, lowest for c.
