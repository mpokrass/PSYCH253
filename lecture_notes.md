# PSYCH 253

## Lecture 2 - Sep 9

Social psychology is the study of social thinking (how we perceive ourselves and others), social influence, and social relations.

### Information Processing Model

Goal-regulation theory. There are many models of human behaviour.

We are biased information processors.

### Theory of mind

Implied consequences of actions. You are able to infer that people around you also have minds and are sentient. Other beings have unobservable mental processes going on.

A _social brain_ is related to interpersonal interactions. Social animals demonstrate complex and large brain mass. 

Eg. chimpanzees can recognize intention.

Social behaviour is learned - we start as ego-centric individuals.

Children under the age of 3.5 fail perspective taking.

People with autism have a lack of social skills, perform poorly at perspective-taking tasks. (eg. with a picture of eyes, telling what they are expressing).

### Social Facilitation

Bike riders did better when in the presence of others. Triplett had people perform against others (simulated fish reeling)

Some individuals are faciliated by the presence of others. But some experienced inhibition of behaviour (nervous tension/anxiety)

Zajonc theorized that dominant responses are augmented by audiences.

Mere presence vs audience have different results.

Arousal and drive result in higher expression of dominant responses.

Yerkes-Dodson law: there is an optimum amount of arousal/drive.

Realistically everyone has their own arousal curve.

## Lecture 3 - sept 14

Where does self-concept/self-identity come from?

We use behaviours to extrapolate instances where we are good at different things and derive abstract representations - self-schemas. It becomes very ingrained, very core to us.

We often change our concept of self depending on our environment, who we interact with. 

We look to other people to evaluate ourselves. 

We use comparisons with other people when we are threatened with our identity/sense of self. We make downward comparisons to increase our mood.

We also make upwards social comparisons => negative mood. Sometimes though, if we have confidence in our own capabilities, looking upwards may not always end up in negative affective state. May be inspiring, if we feel like we could achieve this state.

Happiness moderates impact of social comparisons.

Had people to word unscrambles. Had people perform really fast or slow - makes an implicit social comparison. Test subjects also reported their own ability.

People with below average happiness were more affected by a faster peer. 

Another study: asked participants to create a puppet show with 2 puppets. In order to manipulate comparisons, they had a confederate perform the same tasks. The confederate always got one type of feedback. In the upwards comparison, subjects got got positive feedback, but they were still worse than the confederate. So positive feedback + upwards comparison. Measured changes in mood pre + post comparison. In the downwards comparison condition subjects got rated poorly, but confederate did even worse than them. 

Had happy + sad participants to start. __Look at slides for these result graphs__

In collectivistic cultures achievement is attained as a group, as opposed to individualistic western cultures.

Another study compared reward distributions of collectivists vs individualists. 

Independent variable: performance (high vs low) and anonymity (anonymous vs not)

DV: distribution of monetary rewards

Americans followed equity principle: i did more work so i deserve more.

Chinese followed equality principle, gave equal allocation regardless of work.

Difference disappeared when allocation was anonymous. Anonymity allowed people to lose identity (eg. lose collectivist identity)

Our self-knowledge isn't very objective. Impact bias and planning fallacy (in textbook). 

Impact bias - overrepresenting positive feelings from something, eg team winning or new iphone.

Planning fallacy - when you overrepresent the time we spend working on something. We think that we have laser focus into what our behaviour will be/our motivation. But we can't comprehend all of the extraneous behaviours that influence us. Their are situational influences that modify our behaviour.

Study: record how long we're going to be spending on 10 different activities. 24 different blanks - for each hour in the day, what they might be doing. 

DV: predect how you might feel if team won or lost football game (football fans).

Wins and losses are both mitigated (happier losing, less happy winning) because they see what else is part of their day. 

Another correlational study, observe fans feelings over losses. Very slight increased in baseline mood after loss (so many other things going on in their lives - pychological immune system). 

Same after winning, slight decrease in happiness actually. 

When no game, thanksgiving, high increase in happiness.

We experience feelings completely different to how we predict them. The way we predict them also affects how we experience them.

Another study, participants predicted their happiness and then gave an actual rating. When you add more details to your day, you realize that the impact of the football game is low. We have very poor introspective abilities. 

Another correlation study - what is people's dispositional level of happiness? Predict happiness after getting final grades, and then measure them. Had no correlation to how they actually felt. You think you're gonna feel a certain way - but it actually has no bearing on what you actually feel.
